Chapman has said Syed's defense team never contacted her for her testimony, a fact Syed's current attorneys say amounts to ineffective counsel. </p>\n<p>Asia spoke out on Twitter and an an interview about why she's choosing now to come forward. </p>\n\n<p>An investigator, meanwhile, said he located 41 possible alibi witnesses for the defendant in a murder case profiled in <em>Serial</em>, but only four told him they were contacted by the original defense team for the 2000 trial.</p>\n\n\n<p>Sean Gordon testified that out of 83 potential alibi witnesses, he was able to reach 41. Of those, he said, only four said they were contacted by Cristina Gutierrez, Syed's original lawyer, and none were asked to testify.</p>\n\n<h2>Cameras at the library</h2>\n<p>A former librarian says there were security cameras at the library where an alibi witness said she saw murder suspect Adnan Syed during the time prosecutors said Syed's girlfriend was being killed.</p>\n\n<p>During the hearings earlier this year, Michelle Hamiel testified that there were security cameras at Baltimore's Woodlawn Public Library. However, Hamiel also said the footage was erased every month. Syed was arrested roughly six weeks after Lee was killed.</p>\n<h2>A deeper look at the cell tower data</h2>\n<p>Prosecutors used cell tower data during the first trial of Adnan Syed, saying it placed him at the scene where the body of Hae Min Lee was found in 1999.</p>\n<p>Attorneys for Syed have said cell tower data presented during his first trial was given to a jury without a fax cover sheet warning that the data referred only to outgoing calls, and any information about incoming calls was unreliable.</p>\n\n<p>At the February hearings, Gerald Grant, a cell tower expert, told the court that the warning was crucial in order to accurately read the data.</p>\n<p>Attorney Justin Brown also entered into evidence an affidavit from an AT&amp;T radio frequency engineer who testified for the state at Syed's original trial. At the time, Abraham Waranowitz testified that the cell data placed Syed at the burial scene. But in the affidavit he wrote that he was unaware of the warning about reliability.</p>\n\n<p>\"If I had been made aware of this disclaimer, it would have affected my testimony,\" he wrote, adding that he wouldn't have affirmed a phone's possible location without better understanding the disclaimer.</p>\n<h2>The background</h2>\n<p>The podcast <em>Serial</em> revolved around Syed, now 35 and serving a life sentence. At 19 he was convicted of strangling his ex-girlfriend in a wooded park on the northwestern edge of Baltimore. The show raised questions about the fairness of Syed's trial in Lee's death. It gained a cult following and uncovered evidence that helped prompt a Maryland appeals court to grant a hearing on the possibility of a new trial.</p>\n\n<p>The case had been closed for years when producer Sarah Koenig, a former <em>Baltimore Sun</em> reporter, reopened it in the podcast in 2014, drawing millions of listeners each week &#8212; so many that the podcast shattered Apple's iTunes store's record for downloads, reaching 5 million faster than any other podcast program.</p>\n<p><em>Additional reporting by Mashable</em>. <em>Have something to add to this story?

The site describes Dorn as \"a fellow CSI at the Central City Police Department who suspects there's more to Barry Allen than just his good guy reputation.\"<br />\n<br />\nThat description certainly sounds familiar to those who already know Felton well from his \"Harry Potter\" days, when he played Slytherin student (and eventual Voldemort sympathizer) Draco Malfoy. At first, the thirsty-for-pureblood-pals Draco tries to befriend Harry, only to quickly sour on The Boy Who Lived, and make Harry's life a living hell at every turn.<br />\n<br />\nThe addition of Felton isn't the only exciting thing awaiting \"Flash\" fans this fall: The series also plans to introduce the famous \"Flashpoint\" storyline from the comics (which TVLine explains <a href=\"http://tvline.com/2016/06/20/the-flash-season-3-premiere-title-flashpoint/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>), beginning with the season premiere.<br />\n<br />\nThere's no word yet on exactly when Felton/Dorn will make his debut, or how long his arc will last, though TVLine says he's expected to show up sometime \"early during Season 3.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"The Flash\" returns to The CW on October 4.<br />\n<br />\n[via: <a href=\"http://tvline.com/2016/06/30/the-flash-tom-felton-season-3-cast-julian-dorn-csi/\" target=\"_blank\">TVLine</a>]<br />\n<br />\n<em>Photo credit: Getty Images for Giffoni Film Festival</em><br />\n<br />\n<!-- %Slideshow-365280% -->",

The erstwhile Draco Malfoy has <a href=\"http://tvline.com/2016/06/30/the-flash-tom-felton-season-3-cast-julian-dorn-csi/\" target=\"_blank\">signed on</a> as a series regular for the third season of the CW's super-soap <i>The Flash</i>, appearing as a CSI named Julian Dorn. That makes him a co-worker of Barry Allen, alter ego of the Fastest Man Alive (though have you noticed that, each season, the villain has been explicitly acknowledged as being faster?). Unlike much of the show's <i>dramatis personae</i>, the role is not (as far as we can tell) based on an existing DC Comics character. He, like Felton's beautiful and oh-so-punchable face, is one of a kind.</p>",

The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Thursday because the NFL hasn’t announced the suspension. \nThe longer suspension is dictated by rules in the NFL’s labor agreement based on McClain’s previous violations. \nCowboys traded for McClain before training camp in 2014 after linebacker Sean Lee sustained a season-ending knee injury in the offseason. He got his career back on track with two solid seasons. \n",

          "content": "The list of Cowboys defensive players serving a suspension to open the season has reportedly gotten longer. \nAdam Schefter and Todd Archer of ESPN reported that linebacker Rolando McClain will be suspended for the first 10 games of the season on Thursday afternoon and the Cowboys passed along the same word a short time later. It’s a violation of the league’s substance abuse policy, which was also the reason why McClain was suspended for the first four games of last season. \nMcClain re-signed with the Cowboys this offseason after making 80 tackles and an interception in 11 starts for the team after his suspension came to an end last year. McClain missed the voluntary portion of the team’s offseason program, which owner Jerry Jones said was so he could spend time with his kids although coach Jason Garrett seemed less sanguine about his absence. \nWith McClain out of the picture, the Cowboys will have to shuffle the deck at linebacker. Sean Lee will start with Anthony Hitchens and Kyle Wilber ’s experience starting last year likely putting them ahead of Andrew Gachkar , Damien Wilson and Keith Smith for the other two spots. \nDefensive ends Randy Gregory and Demarcus Lawrence will miss the first four games of the year serving suspensions of their own, leaving the Cowboys awfully short on defense come September. \n",

          "content": "PARIS (AP) — The Latest from soccer's European Championship (all times local): \nRobert Lewandowski fired in a low cross from Kamil Grosicki to score his first goal of the European Championship in the team's fifth match. Grosicki broke down the left flank before providing the assist. \nGOAL: Robert Lewandowski scores for Poland in the 2nd minute. Poland leads Portugal 1-0. \nPortugal's 18-year-old midfielder Renato Sanches is making his first start of the European Championship in the quarterfinal against Poland. \nSanches, a Bayern Munich recruit who has made three appearances in France as a substitute, takes the place of Andre Gomes, who is injured. \nEliseu is starting for injured left-back Raphael Guerreiro. \nPoland manager Adam Nawalka has stuck with the same starting 11 from its round-of-16 win over Switzerland in a penalty shootout. \nHere are the lineups for the quarterfinal between Poland and Portugal in Marseille: \nPoland: Lukasz Fabianski, Lukasz Piszczek, Kamil Glik, Michal Pazdan, Artur Jedrzejczyk, Jakub Blaszczykowski, Grzegorz Krychowiak, Krzysztof Maczynski, Kamil Grosicki, Arkadiusz Milik, Robert Lewandowski. \nPortugal: Rui Patricio, Cedric, Pepe, Jose Fonte, Eliseu, Joao Mario, Renato Sanches, William Carvalho, Adrien Silva, Nani, Cristiano Ronaldo. \nBelgium defender Jan Vertonghen has been ruled out of the rest of the tournament after twisting his ankle in training, a day before his team's quarterfinal game against Wales. \nBelgium coach Marc Wilmots says the Tottenham defender tore ligaments and will likely be out for six to eight weeks. \n\"It's a sporting tragedy for him. Mentally and physically he was completely fit,\" Wilmots says. \nThe absence of his most-capped player (83 games) increases Wilmots' defensive worries ahead of the Wales game. \nWith regulars Vincent Kompany and Nicolas Lombaerts not at the tournament due to injury and Thomas Vermaelen sitting out a suspension, Wilmots will have to rely on a less-experienced replacement. Jordan Lukaku (four caps), Jason Denayer (seven) or Thomas Meunier (eight) could play. \nWales coach Chris Coleman says Vertonghen's injury means \"a big loss to Belgium\" but added \"they've got so much talent\" in order to find suitable replacements. \nUEFA says all 1,818 doping test taken from European Championship players have so far tested negative. \nUEFA says 354 samples collected at matches added to the 1,464 that were taken out-of-competition since Jan. 1. \nResults from testing the blood, urine and serum samples will be used for individual players' biological passports to monitor possible effects of doping over time. \nUEFA says it plans long-term storage of samples taken from Euro 2016 and the Champions League and Europa League for possible re-testing \"due to intelligence received or new analytical techniques becoming available.\" \nUEFA says there will be a moment of applause ahead of the European Championship quarterfinal between Poland and Portugal in honor of the victims of Tuesday's attacks at an airport in Istanbul. \nSuspected militants from the Islamic State group attacked the airport with guns and bombs. At least 44 people have died as a result. \nUEFA says Thursday's tribute is \"in memory of the victims of Tuesday's terrorist attack in Istanbul and other attacks which have occurred during the tournament.\" \nThere was a similar tribute in Marseille ahead of a group stage game between France and Albania in memory of two French police officers who were killed at their home. \nGermany coach Joachim Loew has a full squad to pick from for Saturday's quarterfinal against Italy in Bordeaux after left back Jonas Hector overcame a cold to take part in training. \nOliver Bierhoff, part of Germany's winning Euro 1996 team and who is now part of Loew's backroom staff, said the \"situation is very positive\" and that \"Jonas trained too.\" \nGermany is aiming to beat Italy at a major tournament for the first time. \nBierhoff said Antonio Conte's side is \"definitely the hardest opponent we could meet, not because we always had difficulties against them historically, but because this team is really well organized, concentrated, and has shown itself to be strong in the games so far.\" \nItaly has impressed with 2-0 wins over Belgium and two-time defending champions Spain. \n\"It will be a tough battle,\" Bierhoff said at the side's tournament base in Evian-les-Bains. \"There's huge respect for the Italian team, but no fear.\" \nFrance left back Patrice Evra has made light of the minor hand injury he sustained in training. \nThe 35-year-old Evra hurt his left hand when he fell following a collision with midfielder Moussa Sissoko late in Wednesday's training session; with the team's medical staff quickly applying ice and bandaging it. \nEvra, who was not wearing the bandage when he attended a news conference on Thursday, was in a light-hearted mood when a reporter asked about his injury. \n\"Thanks for asking about me, that's so nice; it touches my heart,\" Evra said, then added jokingly. \"I've only twisted all four fingers, but other than that I'm fine.\" \nEvra is expected to start against Iceland in the quarterfinal at Stade de France on Sunday. \nBelgium captain Eden Hazard has returned to training ahead of the team's European Championship quarterfinal match against Wales. \nHazard missed practice sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday because of a thigh problem. He trained early Thursday at the team's base in Bordeaux, before the Belgians' scheduled departure to the northern city of Lille where Friday's match against Wales is staged. \nThe Chelsea winger is Belgium's most dangerous attacking player and starred in the 4-0 victory over Hungary in the round of 16. \n",

          "content": "SAN DIEGO (AP) — U.S. Customs and Border Protection found that employees acted properly when they fired guns in four incidents dating back to 2012 — including two that left two people dead. \nThe findings were released Thursday by the agency's National Use of Force Review Board, which was established in December 2014 amid widespread criticism that the nation's largest law enforcement agency was slow to investigate such incidents and lacked transparency. \nThe cases involve a Border Patrol agent who fired from Texas at rock-throwers in Mexico, a heavily armed murder suspect who was fatally shot as he fled a Texas house when a Border Patrol agent and other law enforcement officers opened fire, a Border Patrol agent who fired at rock-throwers in Arizona and an Office of Air and Marine crew that fired warning shots and crashed into a vessel off the Southern California coast carrying immigrants, one of whom died. \nThe reviews were launched after federal, state or local prosecutors declined to pursue criminal charges. Here are descriptions of the four incidents provided by Customs and Border Protection: \n—On Oct. 2, 2014, a Border Patrol agent fired one shot at a rock-thrower in Mexico who posed \"an immediate threat.\" Agents who were patrolling the Rio Grande near Escobares, Texas, saw three abandoned rafts and eight people fleeing. They found 682 pounds of marijuana nearby. \nThe suspects threw baseball-sized rocks from Mexico at a Border Patrol vessel that got stuck on a sandbar, leading agents to fire 18 pepper-spray projectiles. The assailants dispersed after the agent fired his rifle; no injuries were reported. \n—On July 22, 2014, a Border Patrol agent shot at a murder suspect in La Joya, Texas, who barricaded himself in a home and fired about 15 shots at law enforcement officials. Agents responded to a call for assistance from Edinburg, Texas, police. Ten law enforcement officials, including a Border Patrol agent, fired their guns at the man, who was struck several times and died at the scene. \n—On May 5, 2012, a Border Patrol agent who was chasing people who had crossed the border illegally from Mexico fired one shot at a rock-thrower in a mountainous area near Nogales, Arizona. The agent said the assailant threw a rock that was larger than a softball from about 25 feet away. There were no reports of injuries. \n— On June 17, 2015, a crew of Customs and Border Protection Office of Air and Marine fired two warning shots and another shot to disable the engine of a boat carrying 20 people illegally from Rosarito Beach, Mexico, to Southern California. The government vessel collided with the boat, throwing the immigrants overboard. One female passenger died. \n",

Norris should step right into an injury-plagued rotation that saw <strong><a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/kershcl01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Clayton Kershaw</a></strong> hit the disabled list with a back injury earlier today. Norris last pitched on June 26, so he could start in place of Kershaw tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Norris began the season in the Atlanta rotation and pitched dreadfully throughout the month of April, logging an ERA just under 9.00 and losing his spot in the rotation. However, Norris made some alterations while working out of the bullpen and forced his way back into the Atlanta rotation, and he&#8217;s been a revelation since. As Fangraphs&#8217; Jeff Sullivan recently examined, Norris ditched an ineffective changeup for a cutter that has been scintillating since its adoption, and the results have been stunning. In 29 1/3 innings since rejoining the rotation, Norris has pitched to a 2.15 ERA with a 29-to-8 K/BB ratio and an enormous 59.2 percent ground-ball rate. Overall, since losing his rotation spot in late April, Norris holds a 2.08 ERA in 47 1/3 innings.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MlbTradeRumors?a=7NzsWeStGcE:6c9sKcYAEd0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MlbTradeRumors?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a>\n</div>",

He began the year in Atlanta's starting rotation, but pitched poorly enough (8.74 ERA) in five starts to be moved to the bullpen. Norris rejoined the rotation on June 4 and has seen much different results, posting a 2.15 ERA in five starts.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"analysis br\">For the season, Norris owns a 4.08 xFIP and a 19.9 strikeout percentage (league average is 21.0 percent) in 70 1/3 innings pitched. Our models currently project him to record a 4.58 ERA and a 16.8 strikeout percentage over the remaining course of the season, but will be updated based on his new team.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSource: <a href=\"http://www.rotoworld.com/player/mlb/5296/bud-norris\" target=\"_blank\">Rotoworld.com</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>",

He has posted a 2.15 ERA over his last five starts, becoming a viable trade chip for a rebuilding Atlanta squad.</p>\n<p id=\"CpWk5E\">In total, Norris has made 22 appearances (10 starts) for Atlanta this year, posting a 4.22 ERA while showing significant improvement in recent weeks. He signed a 1-year, $2.5 million deal with the Braves before the season, meaning he is only controllable through the end of the season. </p>\n<p id=\"iK7BIi\">Norris is a veteran of 8 seasons with four different clubs, owning a 4.43 ERA in 218 appearances (176 starts).</p>\n<p id=\"Axpy66\">Toscano, 27, is a Cuban outfielder who signed a 4-year, $6 million deal with the Braves in December 2014 but has struggled mightily in his first taste of stateside play. Toscano has hit .226/.310/.271 in 58 games for Double-A Mississippi so far this year, so his inclusion in the deal is considered a bit of a salary dump.</p>\n<p id=\"LrWovB\">Pfeiffer, 23, was the Dodgers’ 3rd-round pick in last year’s draft out of Vanderbilt and has posted a 2.97 ERA as a reliever in 17 appearances split between Single-A Great Lakes and High-A Rancho Cucamonga so far this season. He was not ranked by <a href=\"http://m.mlb.com/prospects/2016?list=la\">MLB.com </a>as one of the team’s top 30 prospects at the time of the deal.</p>\n<p id=\"rZM34x\">Dirks, 23, was originally drafted by Atlanta in the 15th round of the 2014 draft before being traded to the Dodgers for an international bonus slot last July. The reliever has posted a stellar 1.44 ERA in 28 appearances with Double-A Tulsa this season, and is ranked as the team’s 30th-best prospect by <a href=\"http://m.mlb.com/prospects/2016?list=la\">MLB.com</a>.</p>",

Joel Sherman of the New York Post confirms the deal. According to Jeff Passan of Yahoo Sports , the Braves will receive two as yet unknown prospects from the Dodgers. \nThe Dodgers placed ace Clayton Kershaw on the disabled list on Thursday, adding to their long list of pitching woes. It was reported that they were actively searching for starting pitching help from outside the organization and it didn’t take them long to strike a deal. \nNorris, 31, has an uninspiring 4.22 ERA, but he has pitched very well since moving back into the Braves’ rotation on June 4. In five starts, he has given up only seven runs (2.15 ERA) on 21 hits and eight walks with 29 strikeouts in 29 1/3 innings. \nNorris is owed the remainder of his $2.5 million salary for the 2016 season. He can become a free agent after the season. \n",

          "content": "MILWAUKEE — The Dodgers are set to plug the latest hole in their starting rotation by acquiring right-hander Bud Norris from the Atlanta Braves in exchange for two minor-league pitchers. \nThe Dodgers also received Double-A outfielder Dian Toscano, a player to be named later and cash considerations from the Braves in exchange for Class-A left-hander Philip Pfeifer (a third-round draft pick out of Vanderbilt last year) and Double-A right-hander Caleb Dirks. Dirks was acquired by the Dodgers from the Braves in a trade for an international bonus slot last year. \nNorris, 31, is 3-7 with a 4.22 ERA for the Braves this season, including 3-5 with a 5.02 ERA in 10 starts. But he has a 2.15 ERA and has held opposing batters to a .200 average in his past five starts (four of them Braves wins). \nThe Braves are in the midst of a homestand and Norris was scheduled to start Friday. The Dodgers need a starter to take Clayton Kershaw’s turn in the rotation Friday at Dodger Stadium against the Colorado Rockies. \nKershaw received an epidural injection in his lower back Wednesday and will be placed on the disabled list until at least the All-Star break. \nNorris is making $2.5 million this year and will be a free agent this off-season. In eight big-league seasons with four teams (the Houston Astros, San Diego Padres, Baltimore Orioles and Braves), Norris is 59-75 with a 4.43 ERA and 1.40 WHIP, primarily as a starter. His best season was 2014 when he went 15-8 with a 3.65 ERA for the Orioles. \nToscano is a 27-year-old Cuban who batted .226 in 58 games for the Braves’ Double-A affiliate this season. \nIn order to clear a spot on their 40-man roster for Norris, the Dodgers designated Triple-A left-hander Ian Thomas for assignment. \n",

          "content": "All around the world, pretty girls ! Including inside Iggy Azalea’s home! Even when she isn’t there! In a series of tweets posted early Thursday morning, the recently single Azalea finally explained why she dumped professional question mark Nick Young. \nThough we originally suspected the split was due to Azalea discovering Young had impregnated his ex, it was just your classic tale of catching a partner cheating on you—only a little more high tech. \nWhile it’s sort of funny to know that Young is dumb enough to bring several women into the home he shares with Azalea knowing full well there are security cameras set up on the property, I do feel for Iggy Iggs on this one. \nIt’s no fun when your relationship turns out to be a flop. \nLouis Tomlinson’s forgettable baby mama, Briana Jungwirth , won’t let him see their son. Or, more accurately, she’s been “inconsistent” with regards to allowing him visitation privilege—so he’s taking her to court. Louie is seeking “joint and legal custody,” meaning there will be a 50/50 split “in terms of the division of time each spends with their son.” \nThe One Direction singer, we’re told, is paying Briana around $15k a month in child support, and a judge will now set whatever amount is deemed appropriate. Louis is also renting a $1 million house for Briana and the kid in Calabasas. \nI don’t know how this trial will go down, but I’d love to see Harry and Niall and Zayn and...the other one...take the stand and explain why they think Louie is a good dad. “‘E can be a wanker sometimes but ‘e loves that baby, I promise you!” \nLIAM ! Liam. The other one is Liam. \nLindsay Lohan was interviewed by Vanity Fair this week and said this about whether or not she has regrets: \nI wouldn’t call things regrets, per se. I can’t turn back time. But if I could, I would have listened more to my mother and gone back home to N.Y.C. earlier in life and chosen my friends more wisely. \nLohan will turn 30 on Saturday. \nSarah Paulson doesn’t understand why she’s mom. (This Vine is old but I don’t care.) [ Vine ] \nAriel Winter is parodying herself at this point. Also, who took that photo? [ People ] \nAre Taylor Kinney and Lady Gaga going to have kids soon? Do we care? [ THG ] \nKim and Ray J ’s sex tape still sells tremendously well. [ THG ] \n",

After all, he did accidentally admit to cheating on her while being filmed by fellow teammate D’Angelo Russell. But despite the viral video, Iggy stuck by her man and tried to rebuild some type of trust. But in an Instagram photo posted last week, Iggy explained how it just wasn’t possible. \nA photo posted by Iggy Azalea (@thenewclassic) on Jun 19, 2016 at 4:05pm PDT \nNow she’s giving new details about their recent split. Apparently the 26-year-old Australian rapper caught Young cheating on her with another woman at their home while she was away. And she has video to prove it. \nSorry Nick, you’re not getting off easy this time. \nOn Thursday, reports claimed Iggy broke up with Young because he’s expecting a second child with his ex-girlfriend Keonna Green. Apparently the two had a drunken hookup and now she’s four months pregnant. \n“[Nick Young] said it was a one-night stand and will never happen again,” an insider reportedly told Life & Style. “This is something [Iggy] can’t ignore, and it ruined their future together.” The magazine also claims that they approached Keonna last week and confirmed the pregnancy, but she refused to comment further. \nIggy tweeted that she knew nothing about the rumors. \nWe sincerely hope this story isn’t true. Breakups are bad enough without having to find out your ex impregnated his side chick. And to find out while watching TV? No. Just no. Iggy, we feel you girl. Forget the loser and move on to someone better. \n",

          "content": "Word came out yesterday (June 29) through celebrity gossip magazine Life and Style that Iggy Azalea had called off her engagement to Los Angeles Lakers guard Nick Young because Young had reportedly impregnated his ex , whom he already had a child with. And while there was certainly good reason for Iggy to give Young the boot, tossing his belongings outside of their shared home just last week, the Aussie rapper says that, contrary to yesterday’s report, Nick has never mentioned an unplanned pregnancy. \n“I have never even been told by nick that his baby mother is pregnant so if this true I’m finding out via E news,” Iggy wrote on Twitter late into the night. “I broke up with Nick because I found out he had brought other women into our home while I was away and caught them on the security footage. This is just like a second shot to the chest. And I feel like I don’t even know who the hell it is I’ve been loving all this time. People in this world really are fucked up.” \nIggy and Nick’s engagement was on the rocks ever since Young’s teammate, D’Angelo Russell, recorded him in secret, speaking rather proudly of his non-Iggy conquests. It’s not clear as of yet whether the security footage Iggy discovered was of those same encounters or entirely new ones, but it’s clear that she is deeply saddened by the revelation, having repeatedly said after the Russell footage was leaked that she was giving Young a second chance. \nRead Iggy’s tweets below, with the possibility of Young changing teams opening up tomorrow (July 1) when the NBA Free Agent period begins. \nI have never even been told by nick that his baby mother is pregnant so if this is true I'm finding out via E news. \n— IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) June 30, 2016 \nI broke up with Nick because I found out he had brought other women into our home while I was away and caught them on the security footage. \n— IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) June 30, 2016 \nThis is just like a second shot to the chest.

          "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — In a study of suicide rates by occupation, the workers that killed themselves most often were farmers, lumberjacks and fishermen. \nResearchers found the highest suicide rates in manual laborers who work in isolation and face unsteady employment. High rates were also seen in carpenters, miners, electricians and people who work in construction. Mechanics were close behind. \nDentists, doctors and other health care professionals had an 80 percent lower suicide rate than the farmers, fishermen and lumberjacks. \nThe lowest rate was in teachers, educators and librarians. \nThursday's report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is perhaps the largest U.S. study to compare suicide rates among occupations. But it is not comprehensive. It only covers 17 states, looking at about 12,300 of the more than 40,000 suicide deaths reported in the entire nation in 2012. \nBecause of the limited data, they could only calculate suicide rates for broad occupation categories, but not for specific jobs. The categories, which sometimes seem to group professions that have little to do with each other, like athletes and artists, are based on federal classifications used for collecting jobs-related data. \nSo it's not clear what the suicide rate is just for farmers. Or for mathematicians. Or journalists. \nSuicide is the nation's 10th leading cause of death. Public attention often focuses on teens and college students, but the highest numbers and rates are in middle-aged adults. Suicide is far more common in males, and the rankings largely reflect the male suicide rates for each group. \nThe highest female suicide rate was seen in the category that includes police, firefighters and corrections officers. The second highest rate for women was in the legal profession. \nIt's not the first time a suicide problem has been noted for some of the jobs. In the 1980s, media reports detailed high suicide rates in Midwestern farmers. That was attributed to a tough economy and farmers use of pesticides that scientists have theorized may cause symptoms of depression. \nThe CDC's occupational suicide list: \n1.

They are each worth $1 million, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association which conducts the game. \nThe numbers drawn Tuesday night were 15, 17, 20, 35, 55 and the Mega number was 7. The estimated jackpot was $390 million. \nThe drawing was the 31st since the last time a ticket with all six numbers was sold. \nThe odds of matching all five numbers and the Mega number is 1 in 258,890,850, according to the Mega Millions website. The overall chance of winning a prize is 1 in 14.71. \nThe Mega Millions game is played in 44 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands. \nAlso see: Hitting The Road This July 4th Weekend?

He purchased $20 worth of Powerball tickets, $10 worth of Mega Millions games -- and with the extra dollar, he purchased the winning Mega Millions game. \nThe next day, Viola checked the Mega Millions ticket online. \n\"The first thing I did was look at the Mega Ball, and the numbers matched up. Then I looked at the rest of the numbers, and they matched up too,\" Viola recalled. \"I think I almost had a heart attack. ...\" \nViola kept her luck a secret for three months, claiming the ticket in March. \nFollowing the drawing, she created a limited liability company, The Orbity Fund LLC. On behalf of The Orbity Fund LLC, she chose to receive her prize in one lump sum. \n\"I still can't believe it,\" Viola said. \"It's surreal, but exciting and wonderful at the same time. I've thought about my plans, and I want to make some investments and just be secure for the future.\" \n",
