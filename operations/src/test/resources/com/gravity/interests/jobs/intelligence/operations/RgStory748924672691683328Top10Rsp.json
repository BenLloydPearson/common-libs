Although it’s unclear if there are casualties, several media outlets are reporting shootings. The Daily Star reports there are five assailants, who have allegedly thrown bombs. \nSumon Reza, a kitchen staff of Holey Artisan Bakery, who managed to escape said several armed assailants entered the restaurant around 8:45pm and took the chief chef hostage. \n“They blasted several crude bombs causing wide-scale panic among everyone. I managed to flee during this confusion,” he said. \nAfter these reports, the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka tweeted: \nReports of shooting and hostage situation in Gulshan 2, Dhaka. Please shelter in place and monitor news. \n— U.S. Embassy Dhaka (@usembassydhaka) July 1, 2016 \nEarlier Friday, ISIS claimed responsibility for killing a Hindu priest in his temple in southwestern Bangladesh. \nShyamananda Das, the 52-year-old priest, was hacked to death by alleged Islamist extremists while he was gathering flowers that would be offered in prayers. Gopinath Kanjilal, assistant superintendent of police in the Jhenaidah district, told CNN: \n“Three men rode up on one bicycle. They were wearing helmets. They jumped off, attacked the priest, and then rushed away.” \nThis is just the latest in a series of attacks against religious minorities and secularists in the predominantly Muslim, but officially secular, South Asian country. Das is the second Hindu priest killed in that district in the last month. \nBangladeshi authorities continue to deny that ISIS and its sympathizers are operating in the country. \n",
