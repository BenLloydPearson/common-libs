The substance then “ignited inside the building, burned some furniture and damaged the building’s interior before going out.”\n\nA local business owner who discovered the damage early Sunday found the words “Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” and a swastika spray-painted on the building next to the GOP office.\n\nSpray painted on the side of the OCGOP when it was fire bombed \"Nazi Republicans leave town or else\" pic.twitter.com/gvduwIpjMw— NCGOP (@NCGOP) October 16, 2016\n\n     \n\n.@NCGOP spox @kamimueller says firebomb was thrown through this window that says \"freedom speaks\". @wsoctv pic.twitter.com/cMpfn45Uhg— Blake Hanson (@BlakeWSOC9) October 16, 2016\n\n     \n\n\nDallas Woodhouse, the executive director of the North Carolina GOP, told Fox News that “the office itself is a total loss,” and called the attack “an utter act of political terrorism.”\n\n“The important thing is nobody was killed. People could have been killed,” he said. “This is a horrifying situation. When you think you have volunteers and offices all across the state, in all kinds of places, and these kind of acts are intended to intimidate, and they are intended to terrorize.”\n\nWoodhouse said that he was not aware of any previous threat made against the office.\n\nLocal officials and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives are investigating who was responsible for the attack and the extent of the damages.\n\n\n\nThe town’s Democratic mayor, Tom Stevens, condemned what he called a “highly disturbing act.”\n\n“This highly disturbing act goes far beyond vandalizing property; it willfully threatens our community’s safety via fire, and its hateful message undermines decency, respect and integrity in civic participation,” he said in a statement.",

    "plain_text": "\n\n     \nThe 15-year-old daughter of U.S. Olympic sprinter Tyson Gay has died after being shot outside of a Kentucky restaurant, police said.\n\nTrinity Gay was in the parking lot of Lexington’s Cook Out restaurant at around 4 a.m. Sunday when witnesses reported gunfire exchanged between two vehicles, police said in a statement. The teen was fatally shot in her neck, LEX 18 News reported, and was pronounced dead at a local hospital.\n\nTrinity was following in her father’s footsteps as a sprinter at Lafayette High School ― the same place where Gay got his start, according to the school.\nHer father, who now lives in central Florida, expressed shock at the morning’s senseless violence.\n\n“She didn’t make it. I’m so confused. She was just here last week for fall break. It’s so crazy. I have no idea what happened,” he told the local news station.\n\nThe teen’s mother echoed the same heartbreak. \n\n     \n“She was so innocent, she was so innocent,” Shoshana Boyd told the New York Daily News. “I just want people to stop shooting and realize who they’re hurting. It’s just random. They don’t understand, they don’t understand who they’re hurting.”\n\nPolice said one of the two vehicles involved in the shootout, a gray Dodge Charger, has been located, and two people were detained for questioning. As of Sunday, authorities are still working to track down the second vehicle, which is described as a dark-colored sports car with tinted windows.\nA police spokeswoman told The Associated Press that the slain teen is not believed to have been in either of the two vehicles.\n\nTrinity’s school and fellow athletes have since expressed their condolences to her family and community on Twitter.\n\nSending our thoughts & prayers to @TysonLGay & his loved ones as they mourn the tragic & senseless loss of his daughter, Trinity.— USATF (@usatf) October 16, 2016\n\n     \n\nPlease join us in keeping the Gay family close in thought and prayer and supporting Lafayette during this unspeakably difficult time.— FayetteCountySchools (@ItsAboutKidsFC) October 16, 2016\n\n     \n\nHeavy heart today for Tyson Gay and his family. \n\nLord please ease their pain and give them strength during this time.— Lolo Jones (@lolojones) October 16, 2016\n\n     \n\nThe Arkansas Razorback athletic family sends its condolences to @TysonLGay and his family during this difficult time.— Razorback XC/TF (@RazorbackTF) October 16, 2016\n\n     \nTyson Gay, who was born in Lexington, earned three gold medals at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan. In the 2012 Olympics in London, he took home a silver medal in the 4x100 meters relay team but later lost it after testing positive for a banned substance in 2013.\n\nAnyone with information about Sunday’s shooting is encouraged to contact police by texting LEXPD, plus the tip, to CRIMES (274637). Information can also be submitted anonymously through Bluegrass Crime Stoppers at (859) 253-2020 or on their website.",

The role of Dabiq in certain end-of-times prophecies, however, gave the town special importance for ISIS.</p>\n<p>Dabiq is where Muslim armies are meant to defeat foreign crusaders in an immense battle before conquering Constantinople and eventually bringing about the end of the world, according to certain Islamic prophecies. ISIS holds this apocalyptic narrative as an explicit part of its ideology, and one that it has increasingly promoted since the group captured Dabiq amid its rapid growth in 2014.</p>\n<p>The Dabiq narrative appears frequently in ISIS propaganda. The group named <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/isis-dabiq-magazine_us_56a7e6cfe4b04936c0e8938a\">its magazine</a> after the town and filmed a number of its beheading and hostage videos there.</p><img src=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset//5803df24170000bc16acc479.jpeg\" data-caption=\"Fighters from the Free Syrian Army fire a machine gun mounted on a vehicle deployed during fighting against the self-described Islamic State near Dabiq.\" data-credit=\"NAZEER AL-KHATIB/Getty Images\"/><p>Losing Dabiq poses some obvious problems for ISIS. The image of Turkish-backed Syrian rebels sweeping into the town in Toyota trucks as ISIS militants flee doesn&rsquo;t square with the grand vision of a victorious battle signaling the end of times.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;ISIS has argued that people should join its movement because it is successful and victorious. Its opponents can now argue that ISIS ran away from a battle that its ideologues have characterized as the most important moment in religious history,&rdquo; J.M. Berger, author of <em>ISIS: State of Terror</em>, told The WorldPost.</p>\n<p>The defeat is the latest blow to ISIS&rsquo; &ldquo;lasting and expanding&rdquo; description of its self-proclaimed caliphate. The group has suffered significant losses both in territory and leadership since the beginning of last year. Along with Dabiq, the group has been pushed out of much of northern Syria and key cities in Iraq. A massive U.S.-backed offensive to take back Mosul, the largest city still under ISIS control, is expected to start soon.</p><img src=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset//5803df871a000067145b9cbb.jpeg\" data-caption=\"A convoy belonging to the Members of Free Syrian Army enters Dabiq, near&amp;nbsp;Aleppo, after driving&amp;nbsp;ISIS&amp;nbsp;terrorists from the village on October 16, 2016.\" data-credit=\"Yasir Al Ahmed/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\"/><p>ISIS attempted to downplay the impending loss of Dabiq last week, saying in its newsletter that this was not the prophesied battle ― which is yet to come. But this is at odds with the group&rsquo;s rhetoric during its expansion in 2014, which claimed that the final battle was quickly approaching.</p>\n<p>The group&rsquo;s reaction to losing Dabiq is similar to the way many doomsday cults react when their comet or flood or other world-ending disaster doesn&rsquo;t materialize. Rather than admit that their prophecy has failed, these groups and leaders tend to <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2011/05/prophecy_fail.html\" target=\"_blank\">retrofit their ideas</a> to resolve any contradictions as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gone back to prophecy to try to find ways to cope with the cognitive dissonance,&rdquo; said Will McCants, author of <em>The ISIS Apocalypse.</em></p>\n<p>&ldquo;You could say they are doing so cynically, but you could also say that this is what apocalyptically-minded people do ―&nbsp;they are constantly shifting when circumstances don&rsquo;t play out the way they expect.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The loss will likely have a divisive effect on ISIS followers, McCants predicted. Although some supporters will be inclined to disassociate themselves from ISIS as its narrative begins to fall apart, there are also those who will see this as a challenge to overcome and harden their belief.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They will frame it as a test for the sincerity of the believer: can you hold on when things aren&rsquo;t going well? Can you hold on when it looks like prophecy hasn&rsquo;t been fulfilled?&rdquo; McCants said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But that is the language of defeat; it&rsquo;s not the language of conquest and victory that they were using two years ago.&rdquo;</p>",

    "plain_text": "\nSyrian rebel fighters pushed ISIS militants out of the northern Syrian town of Dabiq on Sunday, forcing the extremist group to give up ground that is central to its propaganda and apocalyptic ideology.\n\nDabiq had a pre-war population of only a few thousand people, and is of little military value in terms of strategic location or resources. The role of Dabiq in certain end-of-times prophecies, however, gave the town special importance for ISIS.\n\nDabiq is where Muslim armies are meant to defeat foreign crusaders in an immense battle before conquering Constantinople and eventually bringing about the end of the world, according to certain Islamic prophecies. ISIS holds this apocalyptic narrative as an explicit part of its ideology, and one that it has increasingly promoted since the group captured Dabiq amid its rapid growth in 2014.\n\nThe Dabiq narrative appears frequently in ISIS propaganda. The group named its magazine after the town and filmed a number of its beheading and hostage videos there.\nLosing Dabiq poses some obvious problems for ISIS. The image of Turkish-backed Syrian rebels sweeping into the town in Toyota trucks as ISIS militants flee doesn’t square with the grand vision of a victorious battle signaling the end of times.\n\n“ISIS has argued that people should join its movement because it is successful and victorious. Its opponents can now argue that ISIS ran away from a battle that its ideologues have characterized as the most important moment in religious history,” J.M. Berger, author of ISIS: State of Terror, told The WorldPost.\n\nThe defeat is the latest blow to ISIS’ “lasting and expanding” description of its self-proclaimed caliphate. The group has suffered significant losses both in territory and leadership since the beginning of last year. Along with Dabiq, the group has been pushed out of much of northern Syria and key cities in Iraq. A massive U.S.-backed offensive to take back Mosul, the largest city still under ISIS control, is expected to start soon.\nISIS attempted to downplay the impending loss of Dabiq last week, saying in its newsletter that this was not the prophesied battle ― which is yet to come. But this is at odds with the group’s rhetoric during its expansion in 2014, which claimed that the final battle was quickly approaching.\n\nThe group’s reaction to losing Dabiq is similar to the way many doomsday cults react when their comet or flood or other world-ending disaster doesn’t materialize. Rather than admit that their prophecy has failed, these groups and leaders tend to retrofit their ideas to resolve any contradictions as quickly as possible.\n\n“They’ve gone back to prophecy to try to find ways to cope with the cognitive dissonance,” said Will McCants, author of The ISIS Apocalypse.\n\n“You could say they are doing so cynically, but you could also say that this is what apocalyptically-minded people do ― they are constantly shifting when circumstances don’t play out the way they expect.”\n\nThe loss will likely have a divisive effect on ISIS followers, McCants predicted. Although some supporters will be inclined to disassociate themselves from ISIS as its narrative begins to fall apart, there are also those who will see this as a challenge to overcome and harden their belief.\n\n“They will frame it as a test for the sincerity of the believer: can you hold on when things aren’t going well? Can you hold on when it looks like prophecy hasn’t been fulfilled?” McCants said.\n\n“But that is the language of defeat; it’s not the language of conquest and victory that they were using two years ago.”",

For it couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that his foot-swapping stupid mouth had anything to do with all his victims coming forward.</p>\n<p>Here’s the Donald blabbing to the world how he accosts women by feeling them up and giving them uninvited kisses on the lips. Trump even bragged about being the boss of beauty pageants and how he would walk into the dressing rooms unannounced to catch all the young women in different stages of undress – because he could do anything for he’s Donald Trump, the big deal. Of course, after he was heard bragging about his adventures as a voyeur, it outraged some of the contestants enough to now come forward and denounce the creep. To make matters worse, Trump then lies about it during the debate and further infuriates his victims. Many of them had difficulty watching Trump looking directly into the camera and denying his actions with such conviction it takes his abuse to the level of also humiliating his victims as liars. And this is all after the Dumb Donald is heard bragging about the very actions, assaults, these women are claiming against him, the admitted male chauvinist pig.</p>\n<p>It turned out the most important question of the debate was when Anderson Cooper asked Trump (and kept pressing until he got an answer) if he had, in fact, carried out any of the actions that Trump referred to as locker room talk. It was Trump’s emphatic denial to Cooper that emboldened the women he has allegedly assaulted over the years to come out and share their stories of Trump’s sexual attacks, and his peeping tom invasions of privacy in the pageant dressing rooms to get a peek at the young women’s bodies.</p>\n<p>Now because of Trump’s braggadocios remarks about being a Billionaire, soon following those who are truly victims of abuse by Trump are sure to be many others claiming to be assaulted by Gold finger – the man with the Midas touch. And the dummy brought this fickle finger of fate all upon himself! It’s poetic justice at its best. He lit himself on fire with the matches of his own making. Of course, as expected, all this means nothing to the Trump fan, remember these are the people who could see him shoot someone, and I guess now you can add -even rape someone on fifth avenue, and it wouldn’t mean a thing. </p>\n<p>They are standing by their man because he’s going to get the black guy and all of his friends out of the White House as he throws 11 million brown people out of the country – for good. That’s Trump’s plan for making America great again.That’s right Trump has a lock on the bigot vote in this country and there not going anywhere. There is nothing that Trump could do or say, no matter how vulgar or dangerous, that would sway these people away from him. They are fans of his Hate. They show up at his rally in even bigger numbers when Trump is in the news with an even bigger scandal. They know the Trump Show will be even more outrageous with Trump’s uncivil attacks that are meant to incite and feed the frenzy of his fans. They love it when Trump gratuitously attacks Hillary Clinton, while portraying former President Bill Clinton in a manner that accurately describes his own assaults by his own admission. This is a Grammar School ploy being acted out by an adult running for President of the United States. It’s as though he’s the emotional little kid yelling out —blaming someone else for his own actions in an effort to hide his own guilt. Trump is a man accurately described by first lady Michelle Obama as lacking the basic standards of human decency ― and he wants to be our president.</p>",

    "plain_text": "\nThe Trump fans also echo Trump’s words that his victims coming forward with claims of sexual assault are all part of a Clinton/media conspiracy against him, Yup, it’s all Hillary’s fault. For it couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that his foot-swapping stupid mouth had anything to do with all his victims coming forward.\n\nHere’s the Donald blabbing to the world how he accosts women by feeling them up and giving them uninvited kisses on the lips. Trump even bragged about being the boss of beauty pageants and how he would walk into the dressing rooms unannounced to catch all the young women in different stages of undress – because he could do anything for he’s Donald Trump, the big deal. Of course, after he was heard bragging about his adventures as a voyeur, it outraged some of the contestants enough to now come forward and denounce the creep. To make matters worse, Trump then lies about it during the debate and further infuriates his victims. Many of them had difficulty watching Trump looking directly into the camera and denying his actions with such conviction it takes his abuse to the level of also humiliating his victims as liars. And this is all after the Dumb Donald is heard bragging about the very actions, assaults, these women are claiming against him, the admitted male chauvinist pig.\n\nIt turned out the most important question of the debate was when Anderson Cooper asked Trump (and kept pressing until he got an answer) if he had, in fact, carried out any of the actions that Trump referred to as locker room talk. It was Trump’s emphatic denial to Cooper that emboldened the women he has allegedly assaulted over the years to come out and share their stories of Trump’s sexual attacks, and his peeping tom invasions of privacy in the pageant dressing rooms to get a peek at the young women’s bodies.\n\nNow because of Trump’s braggadocios remarks about being a Billionaire, soon following those who are truly victims of abuse by Trump are sure to be many others claiming to be assaulted by Gold finger – the man with the Midas touch. And the dummy brought this fickle finger of fate all upon himself! It’s poetic justice at its best. He lit himself on fire with the matches of his own making. Of course, as expected, all this means nothing to the Trump fan, remember these are the people who could see him shoot someone, and I guess now you can add -even rape someone on fifth avenue, and it wouldn’t mean a thing. \n\nThey are standing by their man because he’s going to get the black guy and all of his friends out of the White House as he throws 11 million brown people out of the country – for good. That’s Trump’s plan for making America great again.That’s right Trump has a lock on the bigot vote in this country and there not going anywhere. There is nothing that Trump could do or say, no matter how vulgar or dangerous, that would sway these people away from him. They are fans of his Hate. They show up at his rally in even bigger numbers when Trump is in the news with an even bigger scandal. They know the Trump Show will be even more outrageous with Trump’s uncivil attacks that are meant to incite and feed the frenzy of his fans. They love it when Trump gratuitously attacks Hillary Clinton, while portraying former President Bill Clinton in a manner that accurately describes his own assaults by his own admission. This is a Grammar School ploy being acted out by an adult running for President of the United States. It’s as though he’s the emotional little kid yelling out —blaming someone else for his own actions in an effort to hide his own guilt. Trump is a man accurately described by first lady Michelle Obama as lacking the basic standards of human decency ― and he wants to be our president.",

Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) said in a debate Saturday night that he was unhappy with <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump&rsquo;s</a> remarks, caught on a hot mic in 2005, that he likes to force himself on women. Thompson said he found Trump&rsquo;s words &ldquo;rude and unacceptable.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Thompson will be voting for the GOP presidential nominee nonetheless. The Pennsylvania Republican, who&rsquo;s running for re-election against Democrat Kerith Strano Taylor, used some words he attributed to his wife to explain why. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;Her explanation to me was that God takes the imperfect, and makes perfect for his purpose,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-bUnXyJ8YQ4?t=4m8s\" target=\"_blank\">Thompson said</a>&nbsp;at the debate at Penn State University.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rationale here is that Trump, whom a growing number of women have <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-running-list-of-all-the-women-whove-accused-donald-trump-of-sexual-assault_us_57ffae1fe4b0162c043a7212?w80c3980y4rhpvi&amp;\">accused of sexual assault</a>, is part of God&rsquo;s plan in spite of his personal failings.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Huffington Post&rsquo;s Igor Bobic reported on this <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-women-tape-church_us_57faac85e4b0b6a4303333e2?vbrchbrmyccot7qfr\">strain of thinking among conservative Christians who are still voting for Trump</a>, despite mounting accusations of sexually predatory behavior by the GOP nominee. As one Trump voter told Bobic, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not electing a moral leader. But God uses people that are immoral and can also do good things.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p>As one Trump supporter, a Kansas Republican Party official, told CNN, &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/10/10/trump-supporter-talks-dismembered-babies-baldwin-bts-nr.cnn\" target=\"_blank\">God can use anybody.</a>&nbsp;He used the harlots.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s all about what God can do.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tony Perkins, head of the influential Family Research Council, affirmed that he would be voting for Trump regardless of the allegations of sexual assault. &ldquo;As I have made clear, my support for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Donald Trump</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the general election was never based upon shared values; rather, it was built upon shared concerns,&rdquo; Perkins explained.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the debate Saturday, Thompson said that, whatever Trump&rsquo;s personal failures, he would still make a more effective commander in chief than his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;When we look at this race, I want a commander in chief that, when our son, who&rsquo;s still active duty, if he in the future is deployed and his unit is under fire, and they need reinforcements, they need someone to come in and save them, I want to have confidence in that person,&rdquo; Thompson said. &ldquo;To me the only candidate for that is Mr. Trump.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p>Strano Taylor, who was a delegate for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the Democratic primary, said she is prouder to vote against Trump than in favor of Clinton.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If my son repeated the things he said, I&rsquo;d have to wash his mouth out with soap,&rdquo; she said of the GOP nominee.</p>\n<p><em>HUFFPOST READERS:&nbsp;What&rsquo;s happening in your state or district?

    "plain_text": "\nRep. Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) said in a debate Saturday night that he was unhappy with Donald Trump’s remarks, caught on a hot mic in 2005, that he likes to force himself on women. Thompson said he found Trump’s words “rude and unacceptable.”\n\nBut Thompson will be voting for the GOP presidential nominee nonetheless. The Pennsylvania Republican, who’s running for re-election against Democrat Kerith Strano Taylor, used some words he attributed to his wife to explain why. \n\n“Her explanation to me was that God takes the imperfect, and makes perfect for his purpose,” Thompson said at the debate at Penn State University.\n\nThe rationale here is that Trump, whom a growing number of women have accused of sexual assault, is part of God’s plan in spite of his personal failings. \n\nThe Huffington Post’s Igor Bobic reported on this strain of thinking among conservative Christians who are still voting for Trump, despite mounting accusations of sexually predatory behavior by the GOP nominee. As one Trump voter told Bobic, “We’re not electing a moral leader. But God uses people that are immoral and can also do good things.”\n\nAs one Trump supporter, a Kansas Republican Party official, told CNN, “God can use anybody. He used the harlots. It’s all about what God can do.”\n\nTony Perkins, head of the influential Family Research Council, affirmed that he would be voting for Trump regardless of the allegations of sexual assault. “As I have made clear, my support for Donald Trump in the general election was never based upon shared values; rather, it was built upon shared concerns,” Perkins explained.\n\nIn the debate Saturday, Thompson said that, whatever Trump’s personal failures, he would still make a more effective commander in chief than his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\n“When we look at this race, I want a commander in chief that, when our son, who’s still active duty, if he in the future is deployed and his unit is under fire, and they need reinforcements, they need someone to come in and save them, I want to have confidence in that person,” Thompson said. “To me the only candidate for that is Mr. Trump.”\n\nStrano Taylor, who was a delegate for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the Democratic primary, said she is prouder to vote against Trump than in favor of Clinton.\n\n“If my son repeated the things he said, I’d have to wash his mouth out with soap,” she said of the GOP nominee.\n\nHUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) should have taken part in the town hall debate for undecided voters last week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Republican senator, who&rsquo;s seeking re-election to a fourth term, originally <a href=\"http://kboi2.com/news/local/idahos-congressional-delegation-backing-trump-as-smoke-clears\" target=\"_blank\">endorsed</a> <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a> for president, despite the firebrand&rsquo;s long history of offensive statements and dubious record as a conservative. In May, Crapo said, &ldquo;Donald Trump is now the presumptive Republican nominee and I will support his nomination.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, after a 2005 &ldquo;Access Hollywood&rdquo; video in which Trump <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-women_us_57f80368e4b0b6a4303210af\">bragged about sexual assault</a>&nbsp;surfaced last week, Crapo seemed to rescind his endorsement. Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;disrespectful, profane and demeaning&rdquo; comments, Crapo declared, should make him ineligible for the highest office in the land. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But now Crapo appears to be experiencing a recent political phenomenon that might be called <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/deb-fischer-donald-trump_us_57fe4819e4b0d505a46b3c76\">unendorser&rsquo;s remorse</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like other vulnerable Republicans who abandoned their nominee a month out from the election, Crapo is taking some serious heat back home from GOP voters and party officials. Idaho County Republicans went so far as to say they <a href=\"http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/politics-government/election/article108323852.html\" target=\"_blank\">wouldn&rsquo;t be putting up lawn signs</a> for Crapo anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So in a televised debate on Friday night with his opponent, Democrat Jerry Sturgill, Crapo seemed to walk back his unendorsement of the Republican standard-bearer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asked how he plans to vote on Nov. 8, Crapo suggested that casting a ballot for Trump <a href=\"http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/oct/14/idaho-sen-crapo-backtracks-says-he-might-still-vot/\" target=\"_blank\">was still a possibility</a>, according to the Spokesman-Review. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t decided yet,&rdquo; the senator said. He went on to say that he would certainly not vote for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. (There are <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_election_in_Idaho,_2016\" target=\"_blank\">eight choices</a> on Idaho&rsquo;s presidential ballot, according to Ballotpedia.)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;Frankly, I believe the country is conflicted over this, because we have choices that are frankly disappointing to the country,&rdquo; Crapo said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m facing that kind of decision myself.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So you can put a sitting U.S. senator in that small sliver of Americans who, after more than a year of presidential campaigning, still needs to hear more about the candidates before making a decision. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crapo isn&rsquo;t the only Republican squirming over his defection from the Trump train. Several lawmakers who called for Trump to step down from the ticket after hearing the &rdquo;Access Hollywood&rdquo; tape later said <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/deb-fischer-donald-trump_us_57fe4819e4b0d505a46b3c76\">they would still vote for him</a>. Some of them tried to argue that they had never really rescinded their endorsements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sen. </span><a href=\"http://nebraskaradionetwork.com/2016/10/12/sen-fischer-stands-by-donald-trump-though-disgusted-by-comments-on-video-audio/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NebraskaRadioNetwork+%28Nebraska+Radio+Network%29\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deb Fischer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (R-Neb.), Rep. </span><a href=\"http://observer.com/2016/10/despite-unease-with-trumps-words-garrett-says-he-will-still-vote-for-party-nominee/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scott Garrett</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (R-N.J.), Rep. </span><a href=\"http://www.al.com/news/mobile/index.ssf/2016/10/rep_bradley_byrne_clarifies_po.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bradley Byrne</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (R-Ala.) and Sen.

    "plain_text": "\nMaybe Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) should have taken part in the town hall debate for undecided voters last week.\n\nThe Republican senator, who’s seeking re-election to a fourth term, originally endorsed Donald Trump for president, despite the firebrand’s long history of offensive statements and dubious record as a conservative. In May, Crapo said, “Donald Trump is now the presumptive Republican nominee and I will support his nomination.”\n\nThen, after a 2005 “Access Hollywood” video in which Trump bragged about sexual assault surfaced last week, Crapo seemed to rescind his endorsement. Trump’s “disrespectful, profane and demeaning” comments, Crapo declared, should make him ineligible for the highest office in the land. \n\nBut now Crapo appears to be experiencing a recent political phenomenon that might be called unendorser’s remorse.\n\nLike other vulnerable Republicans who abandoned their nominee a month out from the election, Crapo is taking some serious heat back home from GOP voters and party officials. Idaho County Republicans went so far as to say they wouldn’t be putting up lawn signs for Crapo anymore. \n\nSo in a televised debate on Friday night with his opponent, Democrat Jerry Sturgill, Crapo seemed to walk back his unendorsement of the Republican standard-bearer.\n\nAsked how he plans to vote on Nov. 8, Crapo suggested that casting a ballot for Trump was still a possibility, according to the Spokesman-Review. “I haven’t decided yet,” the senator said. He went on to say that he would certainly not vote for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. That leaves Trump, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.\n\n“Frankly, I believe the country is conflicted over this, because we have choices that are frankly disappointing to the country,” Crapo said. “And I’m facing that kind of decision myself.”\n\nSo you can put a sitting U.S. senator in that small sliver of Americans who, after more than a year of presidential campaigning, still needs to hear more about the candidates before making a decision.  \n\nCrapo isn’t the only Republican squirming over his defection from the Trump train. Several lawmakers who called for Trump to step down from the ticket after hearing the ”Access Hollywood” tape later said they would still vote for him. Some of them tried to argue that they had never really rescinded their endorsements.\n\nSen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Rep. Scott Garrett (R-N.J.), Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) and Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) all signaled that they believed Trump should step aside after his hot-mic remarks became public. But in the days that followed, they all confirmed that they would still support a Republican ticket with Trump as the headliner. \n\nEditor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.",

They have forced civilians to stay in harm&rsquo;s way during previous battles to defend territory.</p>\n<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday he hoped the United States and its allies would do their best to avoid civilian casualties in an attack on Mosul.</p>\n<p>Reflecting the authorities&rsquo; concerns over a mass exodus that would complicate the offensive, the leaflets told residents &ldquo;to stay at home and not to believe rumors spread by Daesh&rdquo; to cause panic, referring to Islamic State by its Arabic acronym.</p>\n<p>With a pre-war population of around 2 million, Mosul is around 4-5 times the size of any other city recaptured so far from the militants, who swept through northern Iraq in 2014 and also hold a swathe of Syria.</p>\n<p>The U.N. last week said it was bracing for the world&rsquo;s biggest and most complex humanitarian effort in the battle for the city, which could make up to 1 million people homeless and see civilians used as human shields or even gassed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Keep calm and tell your children that it is only a game or thunder before the rain,&rdquo; a leaflet said. &ldquo;Women should not scream or shout, to preserve the children&rsquo;s spirit.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If you see an army unit, stay at least 25 meters away and avoid any sudden movements,&rdquo; another said.</p>\n<p>Iraq earlier this month launched a radio station to help Mosul residents stay safe during the offensive.</p>\n<p>The radio is broadcasting from Qayyara, a town 60 kilometers (about 40 miles) south of Mosul, where the army is massing forces ahead of the offensive.</p>\n<p>Qayyara has also an airfield that will be used as a hub by the U.S.-led coalition to support the offensive in which Kurdish Peshmerga and Sunni tribal fighters are expected to take part.</p>\n<p>Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has not yet made it clear whether Iranian-backed Shi&rsquo;ite paramilitary units will participate in the offensive on the mainly Sunni city.</p>\n<p>Local Sunni politicians and regional Sunni-majority states including Turkey and Saudi Arabia have cautioned that letting Shi&rsquo;ite militias take part in assault could lead to sectarian bloodletting.</p>",

Islamic State militants dragged them off months ago, before they retreated from this sprawling air base and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-free-iraq-isis_us_57ed6c2ae4b024a52d2dc5b9\" target=\"_blank\">its surrounding town</a>&nbsp;in northern Iraq.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Survivors, officials and activists say Islamic State used Qayyarah Airfield West as a jail for its opponents, including Yazidis. Now, it has assumed a different role: it&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a base camp for hundreds of U.S. troops,&nbsp;as it was over a decade ago.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q-West, as it is known to the Americans, will be the key staging area and joint logistics hub for U.S. and Iraqi forces as they wage the biggest operation yet against Islamic State, also known as ISIS: The battle to retake Mosul, Iraq&rsquo;s second largest city. The WorldPost traveled to Q-West last week, the first news outlet to visit the remote base by land since the United States reestablished a base here. (Another team of reporters flew in.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces, Sunni Muslim tribal fighters, Kurdish Peshmerga, lran-linked Shiite militias, Turkmen fighters and Turkish forces have all voiced desire to take part in Mosul&rsquo;s liberation. It shows: A half-dozen checkpoints and outposts, which at least three different groups operate,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dot the road leading to Q-West.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The planned offensive against ISIS, led by Iraqi forces but reliant on U.S. airpower, could see the group driven from Mosul before the end of the year, according to American and Iraqi officials. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But who will control Mosul after ISIS &mdash; and whether the city will descend once more into sectarian violence &mdash; is far from clear.

But support for the group faded when the extremists&rsquo; rule turned out to be even worse than that of the Baghdad-based government.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However,&nbsp;Sunni Arab tribal fighters have also fought and died battling ISIS. Thousands of the tribesmen are set to play an important role in the battle for Mosul, a predominantly Sunni city.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In towns like Qayyarah and camps like Debaga, both Iraqi and Kurdish security forces routinely investigate people for ties to ISIS. Meant to round up residents suspected of being ISIS supporters, collaborators and fighters, these investigations range from gathering local men and having them point out the accused to individual questioning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The investigations are nerve-wracking and sometimes horribly unfair, the men at Debaga camp told The WorldPost.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took a week for one young man The WorldPost interviewed to clear his name. Forty-five days for the man standing next to him. &ldquo;Why did you serve tea to ISIS?&rdquo; security forces asked. &ldquo;Why did you sell them goods at the market?&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-27994277\" target=\"_blank\">Daesh</a>&nbsp;would have killed us,&rdquo; said 37-year-old Abdel Hamid, a teacher from Shirqat, using the Arabic acronym for ISIS.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most Sunni Arabs, especially men, cannot easily leave refugee camps like Dabega to travel to places such as Erbil.

Even prominent Republicans are warning that Trump is undermining basic faith in the electoral process.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Our democracy relies on confidence in election results,&rdquo; a spokesperson for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said this week, &ldquo;and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Appearing on NBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Meet the Press,&rdquo; Pence promised that he and Trump would embrace the election results as legitimate. &ldquo;As Donald Trump said in that first debate, I&rsquo;ll say to you again today, we&rsquo;re going to accept the will of the American people,&rdquo; Pence said.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And in a series of Sunday morning television appearances, two Trump supporters ― former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani ― suggested that Ryan and others were overreacting, saying Trump was really just talking about media bias and not widespread cheating at the polls.</span></p>\n<p>On&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/newt-gingrich-backs-rigged-election-claim-voters-monitor/story?id=42830113\">ABC&rsquo;s &ldquo;This Week,&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarthaRaddatz\">Martha Raddatz</a>&nbsp;asked Gingrich about Trump&rsquo;s refrain that&nbsp;&ldquo;they are attempting to rig the election.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p>&ldquo;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So who are &lsquo;they&rsquo; and how are they doing this?&rdquo; Raddatz asked.</span></p>\n<p>Gingrich replied that &ldquo;they&rdquo; are the media.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not about election officials at the precinct level,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is about last Friday when the networks spent 23 minutes on the Trump tape and less than one minute ― all three networks combined ― less than one minute on the Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s secret speeches that were being revealed on WikiLeaks.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem with this explanation and defense, as Raddatz quickly pointed out to Gingrich, is that Trump has explicitly and repeatedly warned of voter fraud ― and told his supporters to serve as poll monitors in precincts where illegal voting is most likely.</span></p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s mentioned the issue<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;on at least three occasions in rural or western parts of Pennsylvania, warning about the possibilities of cheating in Philadelphia. The argument has obvious racial overtones, since his audiences are almost entirely white, and Philadelphia, like most large cities, has a significant African-American population.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was Trump in&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/01/trump-urges-supporters-to-monitor-polling-places-in-certain-areas/\">Manheim</a>, a borough outside of Harrisburg:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;&ldquo;Go and vote and then go check out areas because a lot of bad things happen, and we don&rsquo;t want to lose for that reason.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was Trump in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/12/donald-trump-says-hell-only-lose-pennsylvania-where-hes-down-9-points-is-if-cheating-goes-on/\">Altoona</a>, a small city about halfway between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh:&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don&rsquo;t come in and vote five times. ...

It&rsquo;s at the news media level.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p>Pence, appearing on CBS &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sunday-mike-pence-tim-kaine-new-2016-polls-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">Face the Nation</a>,&rdquo; also endorsed the call for poll monitoring, brushing off concerns that doing so might intimidate minority voters who would be more likely to vote for Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;People that are concerned about this election and about us preserving the one person, one vote that&rsquo;s at the very center of our American democracy, should become involved, should volunteer at their neighborhood polling place,&rdquo; Pence said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how we ensure the accountability. Frankly, that&rsquo;s how we protect the integrity of the vote for Republicans, Democrats, Independents.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And then, on early Sunday afternoon, Trump went even further ― with that tweet speculating that both media bias <em>and</em> voter fraud would taint the election.</p>\n<p><em>This post and its headline have been updated to reflect a tweet Trump sent out Sunday afternoon.</em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Editor&rsquo;s note: Donald Trump regularly </span></em><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost\n.com/entry/donald-trump-violence_us_56e1f16fe4b0b25c91815913\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">incites political violence</span></em></a><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and is a </span></em><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-911_565b1950e4b08e945feb7326\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">serial liar</span></em></a><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span></em><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost\n.com/entry/9-outrageous-things-donald-trump-has-said-about-latinos_55e483a1e4b0c818f618904b\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rampant xenophobe</span></em></a><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span></em><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost\n.com/entry/donald-trump-racist-examples_us_56d47177e4b03260bf777e83\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">racist</span></em></a><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span></em><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost\n.com/entry/18-real-things-donald-trump-has-said-about-women_us_55d356a8e4b07addcb442023\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">misogynist</span></em></a><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span></em><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-stephen-colbert-birther_56022a33e4b00310edf92f7a\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">birther</span></em></a><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims &mdash; 1.6 billion members of an entire religion &mdash; from entering the U.S.</span></em></p>",

    "plain_text": "\nA surrogate for Donald Trump tried to downplay the growing number of sexual assault claims against the Republican presidential nominee as a “she said, he said” situation, before CNN’s Jake Tapper snapped her back to reality.\n\nDuring an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” with Tapper, Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-N.C.) affirmed that the behavior Trump is accused of is indeed sexual assault, adding, “I’m not going to debate who’s telling the truth, but it’s a ‘she said, he said’ situation.” \n\n“It’s more of a ‘she said, she said, she said, she said, she said, she said, she said, she said’ situation,” Tapper noted.\n\n.@Jaketapper on Trump accusations: \"its a he said/she said, she said, she said, she said... situation.\" #CNNSOTU https://t.co/pFwXvgKKxm— State of the Union (@CNNSotu) October 16, 2016\n\n     \nMore than a dozen women have accused the Republican presidential nominee of sexual harassment and sexual assault. Trump has summarily denied the claims despite bragging in a 2005 tape published a week earlier about how he gets away with predatory behavior on account of his celebrity status. \n\nTapper’s response echoes some reactions to the Bill Cosby rape scandal in which dozens of women accused the star of rape and sexual misconduct that in some cases dated back decades. \n\nEllmers quickly tried to pivot to Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton, noting the various allegations of sexual assault against her husband. \n\nEditor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.",

They have done so in pursuit of our mission to keep the United Kingdom safe,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;GCHQ has a proud history of valuing and supporting individuals who think differently; without them we would be of little value to the country.

It aims to raise awareness of mental health issues.\n\nValerie Middleton, the paternal grandmother of The Duchess of Cambridge, who worked @bletchleypark during #WWII pic.twitter.com/mBVY1BDW2s— Clarence House (@ClarenceHouse) June 18, 2014\n\n     \nIn her forward, Middleton emphasizes the “importance of mental wellbeing” while introducing the set of brainteasers that were crafted by GCHQ staff. She also elaborates on her personal connection to some of British intelligence’s top codebreakers and cryptographers through her grandmother, who worked at the famous code-breaking site of Bletchley Park.\n\n“I have always been immensely proud of my grandmother, Valerie Glassborow, who worked at Bletchley Park during the Second World War,” the Duchess wrote. “She and her twin sister, Mary, served with thousands of other young women as part of the great Allied effort to break enemy codes. They hardly ever talked about their wartime service, but we now know just how important the men and women of Bletchley Park were, as they tackled some of the hardest problems facing the country.”\n\nAccording to Vanity Fair, Glassborow went on to marry Kate’s grandfather, British military pilot Peter Middleton, in 1946. She died in 2006 at the age of 82. That was five years before Kate Middleton married Prince William.\n\nIn sharing her story, Middleton not only honors her grandmother’s legacy but stresses her hope that her grandmother’s work will continue to make a positive impact.\n“William, Harry and I are very grateful that this book is supporting our Heads Together campaign. I hope it will not only amuse and challenge readers, but help to promote an open discussion of mental health problems, which can affect anyone, regardless of age or background,” she continued. “Together, we are aiming to change the national conversation around mental health from stigma and fear to openness and understanding. Those who buy this book and support the Heads Together campaign will be playing a part in helping people get the important mental health care they deserve.”\n\nIn the book’s introduction, GCHQ Director Robert Hannigan also emphasized the importance of people “who think differently.”\n\n“For nearly one hundred years, the men and women of GCHQ, both civilian and military, have been solving problems. They have done so in pursuit of our mission to keep the United Kingdom safe,” he wrote. “GCHQ has a proud history of valuing and supporting individuals who think differently; without them we would be of little value to the country. Not all are geniuses or brilliant mathematicians or famous names, but each is valued for his or her contribution to our mission.”\n\nThe book, published by Penguin Random House, goes on sale Oct. 20.",

When Ang Lee introduced the world premiere of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUULFJ_I048\" target=\"_blank\">Billy Lynn&rsquo;s Long Halftime Walk</a>&rdquo; at the <a href=\"https://production-kraken-preview.use1.huffpo.net/entry/new-york-film-festival-preview-2016_us_57ec4266e4b024a52d2cc15a/preview?preview=57ec4266e4b024a52d2cc15b\" target=\"_blank\">New York Film Festival</a> on Friday evening, the veteran director was visibly nervous. &ldquo;Please give this a chance,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Have an open mind.&rdquo; Lee was so earnest that I felt nervous on his behalf. This is his baby!</p>\n<p>Forgive me, then, if I feel a mild moral dilemma in writing this review. I want so badly for Lee to succeed. He&rsquo;s arguably today&rsquo;s most groundbreaking filmmaker, thanks to the international acclaim of &ldquo;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,&rdquo; the nuances of &ldquo;Brokeback Mountain&rdquo; and the nautical visuals of &ldquo;Life of Pi.&rdquo; Sadly, &ldquo;Billy Lynn&rsquo;s Long Halftime Walk&rdquo; is an admirable misfire.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No movie like &ldquo;Billy Lynn&rdquo; has ever been made. Stick with this technical jargon for just a minute: Most feature films are shot at 24 frames per second, but Lee made this one at a record-breaking 120. (It was a <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hobbit-desolation-smaug-48-frames-655444\" target=\"_blank\">polarizing milestone</a> in 2012 when Peter Jackson made the &ldquo;Hobbit&rdquo; series at 48 frames per second.)&nbsp;To boot, Lee shot the film in 3D <em>and </em>using 4K resolution. The NYFF venue installed a new RealD screen specifically for this premiere. Combined, these techniques create a hyperrealism even surpassing the weird motion-smoothing (aka &ldquo;the soap-opera effect&rdquo;) that is now a preset on some high-definition televisions.&nbsp;</p><img src=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset//58029e5f1a000067145b9b6b.jpeg\" data-caption=\"\" data-credit=\"Sony\"/><p>Most theaters aren&rsquo;t equipped to project this technology, so much of the world will see the film in a more typical style. But I saw it with all of Lee&rsquo;s bells and whistles intact, so that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ll discuss it. And here&rsquo;s the thing: Its supposed heightened realness ― a super-sharpness, if you will ― actually makes the film look incredibly cheap. The visuals are jarring and distracting, like you&rsquo;re seeing something at once unfinished and overdone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how many of the &ldquo;Billy Lynn&rdquo; flaws are the result of its mechanics and how many are the fault of the story itself. At first blush, the script feels weak and the performances stilted. Are the cameras to blame?&nbsp;The expository dialogue? The awkward segues between flashbacks and present-day events? I owe this movie another viewing to decide, but I&rsquo;m inclined to think it&rsquo;s a mixture of all these things.</p>\n<p>Based on Ben Fountain&rsquo;s celebrated 2012 novel and adapted by&nbsp;<span class=\"itemprop\">Jean Christophe Castelli, &ldquo;Billy Lynn&rsquo;s Long Halftime Walk&rdquo; is the story of, well, Billy Lynn&rsquo;s long halftime walk.&nbsp;Billy is an Iraq War soldier who, in 2004, has been temporarily released for a victory tour with his seven comrades. &ldquo;American heroism has a new face today,&rdquo; a newscaster announces at the film&rsquo;s start, describing a brutal video of Billy killing an Iraqi enemy. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"itemprop\">Billy and the squadron are paraded around at a Thanksgiving Day football game where they are told they&rsquo;ll appear alongside Destiny&rsquo;s Child at the halftime show. Billy, played by capable newcomer Joe Alwyn, doesn&rsquo;t realize the gravity of his PTSD ― only his left-wing sister (Kristen Stewart) does. All the while, a pushy Hollywood producer (Chris Tucker) is trying to option the fleet&rsquo;s story for a movie, the guys are being feted by a greedy billionaire football manager (Steve Martin), and Billy has irrationally fallen for a flirty NFL cheerleader (Makenzie Leigh) who offers a respite from his strife.&nbsp;</span></p><img src=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset//58029e9f1a00008f205b9b6e.jpeg\" data-caption=\"\" data-credit=\"Sony\"/><p>The movie weaves in and out of wartime flashbacks, some more effective than others. For a story so vital, it has little emotional resonance. The technology, as Lee describes it, is meant to place us inside Billy&rsquo;s perspective. Sometimes it succeeds. But the action surrounding Billy is so phony and constructed that the meat of the narrative comes up hollow. Here, the camera can&rsquo;t lie. When a performance is bad (and several are), it&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>really</em> bad.</p>\n<p>To its detriment,&nbsp;&ldquo;Billy Lynn&rdquo; shies away from issuing many resounding takeaways about the horrors of war. A couple of scenes ―&nbsp;particularly a close-up of Billy strangling an Iraqi adversary ― do offer combat footage more harrowing than the typical rumble of Hollywood&rsquo;s kinetic battle sequences, but as soon as they&rsquo;re over, we return to a lifeless drip that fails to break ground as a character study.&nbsp;As a story, &ldquo;Billy Lynn&rdquo; should be more of a satire, like the novel. It&rsquo;s silly for these troops to be touted as mythical heroes so that others can profit or feel warm fuzzies about our military&rsquo;s sacrifices. But the script treats individual plot threads too seriously (the movie-rights bit is endless), and the visuals bury the satire. By the time we&rsquo;re watching a Destiny&rsquo;s Child reenactment, it seem like an all-out spoof. (Sorry, but you can&rsquo;t half-ass an impersonation of Beyonc&eacute;, one of the most beloved celebrities in the world, in 2016 ― especially not while she&rsquo;s singing &ldquo;Soldier&rdquo; alongside Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams and actual soldiers.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lee&rsquo;s stylings are too earnest for this material. Still, I applaud him for taking a risk ― something not enough filmmakers in today&rsquo;s superhero-saturated Hollywood are willing to do. This, however,&nbsp;is not the future of cinema.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Billy Lynn&rdquo; is worth a watch for anyone who wants to see a daring director break new ground. We should all want to see that! But instead of a triumph, it&rsquo;s a lesson learned. Movies are just fine with the pretty, manipulated gloss that we&rsquo;re used to, the sheen that hides errors and enhances emotions. Without it,&nbsp;this one feels like a very long walk indeed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;Billy Lynn&rsquo;s Long Halftime Walk&rdquo; opens in theaters Nov. 11.</em></p>",

    "plain_text": "\nIt’s hard to criticize the work of someone who pours their soul into a pioneering piece of art. When Ang Lee introduced the world premiere of “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” at the New York Film Festival on Friday evening, the veteran director was visibly nervous. “Please give this a chance,” he urged. “Have an open mind.” Lee was so earnest that I felt nervous on his behalf. This is his baby!\n\nForgive me, then, if I feel a mild moral dilemma in writing this review. I want so badly for Lee to succeed. He’s arguably today’s most groundbreaking filmmaker, thanks to the international acclaim of “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” the nuances of “Brokeback Mountain” and the nautical visuals of “Life of Pi.” Sadly, “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” is an admirable misfire. \n\nNo movie like “Billy Lynn” has ever been made. Stick with this technical jargon for just a minute: Most feature films are shot at 24 frames per second, but Lee made this one at a record-breaking 120. (It was a polarizing milestone in 2012 when Peter Jackson made the “Hobbit” series at 48 frames per second.) To boot, Lee shot the film in 3D and using 4K resolution. The NYFF venue installed a new RealD screen specifically for this premiere. Combined, these techniques create a hyperrealism even surpassing the weird motion-smoothing (aka “the soap-opera effect”) that is now a preset on some high-definition televisions. \nMost theaters aren’t equipped to project this technology, so much of the world will see the film in a more typical style. But I saw it with all of Lee’s bells and whistles intact, so that’s how I’ll discuss it. And here’s the thing: Its supposed heightened realness ― a super-sharpness, if you will ― actually makes the film look incredibly cheap. The visuals are jarring and distracting, like you’re seeing something at once unfinished and overdone. \n\nI’m not sure how many of the “Billy Lynn” flaws are the result of its mechanics and how many are the fault of the story itself. At first blush, the script feels weak and the performances stilted. Are the cameras to blame? The expository dialogue? The awkward segues between flashbacks and present-day events? I owe this movie another viewing to decide, but I’m inclined to think it’s a mixture of all these things.\n\nBased on Ben Fountain’s celebrated 2012 novel and adapted by Jean Christophe Castelli, “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” is the story of, well, Billy Lynn’s long halftime walk. Billy is an Iraq War soldier who, in 2004, has been temporarily released for a victory tour with his seven comrades. “American heroism has a new face today,” a newscaster announces at the film’s start, describing a brutal video of Billy killing an Iraqi enemy. \n\nBilly and the squadron are paraded around at a Thanksgiving Day football game where they are told they’ll appear alongside Destiny’s Child at the halftime show. Billy, played by capable newcomer Joe Alwyn, doesn’t realize the gravity of his PTSD ― only his left-wing sister (Kristen Stewart) does. All the while, a pushy Hollywood producer (Chris Tucker) is trying to option the fleet’s story for a movie, the guys are being feted by a greedy billionaire football manager (Steve Martin), and Billy has irrationally fallen for a flirty NFL cheerleader (Makenzie Leigh) who offers a respite from his strife. \nThe movie weaves in and out of wartime flashbacks, some more effective than others. For a story so vital, it has little emotional resonance. The technology, as Lee describes it, is meant to place us inside Billy’s perspective. Sometimes it succeeds. But the action surrounding Billy is so phony and constructed that the meat of the narrative comes up hollow. Here, the camera can’t lie. When a performance is bad (and several are), it’s really bad.\n\nTo its detriment, “Billy Lynn” shies away from issuing many resounding takeaways about the horrors of war. A couple of scenes ― particularly a close-up of Billy strangling an Iraqi adversary ― do offer combat footage more harrowing than the typical rumble of Hollywood’s kinetic battle sequences, but as soon as they’re over, we return to a lifeless drip that fails to break ground as a character study. As a story, “Billy Lynn” should be more of a satire, like the novel. It’s silly for these troops to be touted as mythical heroes so that others can profit or feel warm fuzzies about our military’s sacrifices. But the script treats individual plot threads too seriously (the movie-rights bit is endless), and the visuals bury the satire. By the time we’re watching a Destiny’s Child reenactment, it seem like an all-out spoof. (Sorry, but you can’t half-ass an impersonation of Beyoncé, one of the most beloved celebrities in the world, in 2016 ― especially not while she’s singing “Soldier” alongside Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams and actual soldiers.) \n\nLee’s stylings are too earnest for this material. Still, I applaud him for taking a risk ― something not enough filmmakers in today’s superhero-saturated Hollywood are willing to do. This, however, is not the future of cinema.\n\n“Billy Lynn” is worth a watch for anyone who wants to see a daring director break new ground. We should all want to see that! But instead of a triumph, it’s a lesson learned. Movies are just fine with the pretty, manipulated gloss that we’re used to, the sheen that hides errors and enhances emotions. Without it, this one feels like a very long walk indeed. \n\n“Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” opens in theaters Nov. 11.",

    "plain_text": "\nArcos Dorados, the world’s largest McDonald’s franchisee and the largest operator of fast-food restaurants in Latin America, said in a statement that it will serve exclusively cage-free eggs by 2025, a shift that will impact the welfare of millions of animals.\n\nThe new policy, developed in conjunction with Humane Society International, reflects a growing focus by U.S. animal protection groups on securing cage-free commitments internationally. Burger King recently announced a similar pledge for its Latin American supply chain.\n\nRoughly 5 billion egg-laying chickens are raised each year worldwide and most spend their entire lives intensively confined, held in small wire enclosures called battery cages. \n\nPeter Singer, a professor of bioethics at Princeton University, refers to caged hens as “the most closely confined, overcrowded and generally miserable animals in America.” In Latin America, where Arcos Dorados operates most of its 2,100 restaurants, conditions for these birds are even worse.\nThe region’s industrial animal farms still subject egg-laying hens to a practice called “forced molting,” which is illegal in Europe and uncommon in the United States.\n\nBirds are deprived of light and intentionally starved for several days to induce stress, which causes them to shed and regrow their feathers. They temporarily stop laying eggs while molting, providing their reproductive systems time to recuperate, and subsequently, they produce better quality eggs.\n\nEgg-laying chickens in Latin America are also packed about 30 percent more tightly than in U.S. factory farms. A typical hen raised in Mexico or Brazil will live out its one- or two-year existence within the space of 48 square inches.\n\nArcos Dorados said its new policy is aimed at fulfilling growing global demand for more humanely raised animal products.\n\nEighty-six percent of meat-eating Americans said it was important to them that farm animals were treated humanely, according to a national HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted last year. Concern for the treatment of farm animals spanned party affiliation, income level, sex and race.\n\n     \nRecent campaigns to end the use of battery cages in the U.S. have been the most successful in the history of farm animal welfare, advocates say. In the last two years alone, every major grocery and fast-food chain in the country has committed to selling only cage-free eggs.\n\nSeveral animal protection groups are now attempting to replicate that success abroad, and Latin America is a major focus. Mexico and Brazil are the fourth- and fifth-largest egg producing countries in the world, respectively, behind only China, the United States and India.\n\nOne group, Animal Equality, last week released the first undercover video from inside a large industrial hen farm in Mexico. The graphic footage shows birds subjected to forced molting and held in cages with other chickens that are dead or dying. \n\nNico Pitney is a senior editor at The Huffington Post. Tips? Feedback?

I will be the most outspoken voice in the Senate. Nothing could have more impact than to send me to the Senate!&rdquo; Duke says in the letter, adding that he would work to preserve&nbsp;&ldquo;our heritage&rdquo; if elected.</p>\n<p>The white nationalist even used some of Trump&rsquo;s own rhetoric to accuse the media of distorting his record.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The media has raked me over the coals, targeted me, lied endlessly about me, but I have never given up. I&rsquo;m still standing, still fighting, and I remain unbroken,&rdquo; the letter said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Duke closed the missive by urging supporters to donate to his campaign, offering to throw in an autographed hat with the words &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for Duke &amp; Trump!&rdquo; emblazoned on the front for any contribution of $50 or more.</p>\n<p>Attempts to reach Duke&rsquo;s campaign on Sunday were unsuccessful. The voicemail box corresponding to the phone number at his office in Mandeville, Louisiana,&nbsp;was full.&nbsp;A request for comment to Trump&rsquo;s campaign was not immediately returned.</p>\n<p>After this story was published <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_372602009\"><span class=\"aQJ\">on Sunday</span></span>, a second person told HuffPost he, too, had received the letter at his residence in Florida.</p>\n<p>Dr. Jamie Amir, who was born in London to a Pakistani father and a Maltese mother, said he was distraught upon receiving the letter, which was addressed to his 6-year-old daughter.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My wife and I were horrified to receive this letter addressed to our innocent sweet daughter from this prolific racist, especially since we don&rsquo;t even live in his state, we live in Florida! Certainly David Duke needs to work on his targeting,&rdquo; Amir wrote in an email.</p>\n<p>Although he has lived in the U.S. since 2003, Amir said he decided to get his U.S. citizenship this year in order to vote in the election. He added that he was proud to belong to &ldquo;a very culturally diverse family,&rdquo; a photo of which he shared, that he said represented &ldquo;the complete antithesis of David Duke&rsquo;s message.&rdquo;</p><img src=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset//5803df821b0000df1cef768a.png\" data-caption=\"Dr. Amir's family. From left: Heather, Julian, Lila, Jamie and Jasmine.\" data-credit=\"Dr. Jamie Amir\"/><p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time Duke had associated himself with the GOP nominee.&nbsp;In August, Trump&rsquo;s campaign <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/david-duke-trump-robocall-227510#ixzz4NGjDtDHN\" target=\"_blank\">disavowed</a> a robocall from Duke in which he urged Louisiana residents to &ldquo;vote for Donald Trump for president and vote for me, David Duke, for the U.S. Senate.&rdquo;&nbsp;The former KKK leader has encouraged his radio show listeners to volunteer for Trump&rsquo;s campaign. And his own campaign website is filled with positive mentions of the real estate mogul.</p>\n<p>Trump has disavowed Duke&rsquo;s support, but that hasn&rsquo;t stopped white supremacists from flocking to Trump&rsquo;s campaign. Over the weekend, a Trump supporter left a sign <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/10/13/donald-trump-rally-swastika-media-sign-acosta-tsr-sot.cnn\" target=\"_blank\">emblazoned with a swastika</a>&nbsp;in the press area following a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida.</p>\n<p>Read Duke&rsquo;s two-page letter below:&nbsp;</p><img src=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset//5803b5e21a000067145b9c5f.png\" data-caption=\"\" data-credit=\"The Huffington Post\"/><img src=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset//5803b6061a00008f205b9c60.png\" data-caption=\"\" data-credit=\"The Huffington Post\"/><p><em>This story has been updated with information from Jamie Amir.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>HUFFPOST READERS:&nbsp;</strong>What&rsquo;s happening in your state or district?

    "plain_text": "\n\n     \nFormer KKK leader David Duke, who is running for U.S. Senate in Louisiana, urged residents of the Bayou State to back him and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in a fundraising letter mailed last week.\n\nIn the Oct. 6 letter, which was obtained by The Huffington Post, the former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard boasted that he spent years speaking out about the same issues the GOP nominee has tackled this election cycle and claimed he would “encourage Trump to go even further to save America.”\n\n“Thank God Trump has emerged and embraced my issues such as stopping immigration, fair trade not free trade, and America First. I will be the most outspoken voice in the Senate. Nothing could have more impact than to send me to the Senate!” Duke says in the letter, adding that he would work to preserve “our heritage” if elected.\n\nThe white nationalist even used some of Trump’s own rhetoric to accuse the media of distorting his record.\n\n“The media has raked me over the coals, targeted me, lied endlessly about me, but I have never given up. I’m still standing, still fighting, and I remain unbroken,” the letter said. \n\nDuke closed the missive by urging supporters to donate to his campaign, offering to throw in an autographed hat with the words “I’m for Duke & Trump!” emblazoned on the front for any contribution of $50 or more.\n\nAttempts to reach Duke’s campaign on Sunday were unsuccessful. The voicemail box corresponding to the phone number at his office in Mandeville, Louisiana, was full. A request for comment to Trump’s campaign was not immediately returned.\n\nIt wouldn’t be the first time Duke had associated himself with the GOP nominee. In August, Trump’s campaign disavowed a robocall from Duke in which he urged Louisiana residents to “vote for Donald Trump for president and vote for me, David Duke, for the U.S. Senate.” The former KKK leader has encouraged his radio show listeners to volunteer for Trump’s campaign. And his own campaign website is filled with positive mentions of the real estate mogul.\n\nTrump has disavowed Duke’s support, but that hasn’t stopped white supremacists from flocking to Trump’s campaign. Over the weekend, a Trump supporter left a sign emblazoned with a swastika in the press area following a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nRead Duke’s two-page letter below: \nHUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

That, Stelter argues, needs to change.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;[O]ver time, the repetition, Trump&rsquo;s lies about election rigging have become a form of background noise, more of the same, and this is a propaganda technique, whether Trump knows it or not,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you say something often enough, if you plant enough seeds, people start to wonder, &lsquo;Will my vote matter? Will it actually count?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As an example, Stelter pointed to a clip of Trump hinting at voter fraud and crooked polls during a speech in Philadelphia on Monday. That clip was only played once on CNN.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We as a country cannot allow ourselves to become numb to this,&rdquo; Stelter urged, noting that there is zero evidence of such fraud. &ldquo;We as a media cannot shrug it off as old news ... Some of his supporters believe him.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump is encouraging his supporters to act as <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-rigged-election_us_5803876de4b0162c043c7d1f?o7yg3tm5boz05asjor\">poll monitors</a> in battleground states, and his efforts to cast doubt on the election system have inspired some supporters to call for a &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; if he loses the election on Nov. 8, clips played by Stelter showed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Mr. Trump, think of your children,&rdquo; Stelter concluded. &ldquo;America is great partly because everyone accepts the results of elections, for decades in the past and hopefully for decades to come. Inventing a conspiracy theory is no way to make America great again.&rdquo;</p><p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Editor&rsquo;s note: Donald Trump regularly\n</span></em><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost\n.com/entry/donald-trump-violence_us_56e1f16fe4b0b25c91815913\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">incites\npolitical violence</span></em></a><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and is a </span></em><a\nhref=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-911_565b1950e4b08e945feb7326\"><em><span\nstyle=\"font-weight: 400;\">serial liar</span></em></a><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span></em><a\nhref=\"http://www.huffingtonpost\n.com/entry/9-outrageous-things-donald-trump-has-said-about-latinos_55e483a1e4b0c818f618904b\"><em><span\nstyle=\"font-weight: 400;\">rampant xenophobe</span></em></a><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,\n</span></em><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost\n.com/entry/donald-trump-racist-examples_us_56d47177e4b03260bf777e83\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\n\">racist</span></em></a><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span></em><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost\n.com/entry/18-real-things-donald-trump-has-said-about-women_us_55d356a8e4b07addcb442023\"><em><span\nstyle=\"font-weight: 400;\">misogynist</span></em></a><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span></em><a\nhref=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-stephen-colbert-birther_56022a33e4b00310edf92f7a\"><em\n><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">birther</span></em></a><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who has\nrepeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims &mdash; 1.6 billion members of an entire religion &mdash; from\nentering the U.S.</span></em></p>",

    "plain_text": "\n\n     \nDonald Trump’s ongoing effort to convince his supporters that the election is rigged is a dangerous threat to American democracy and the media needs to call him out, CNN’s Brian Stelter said Sunday. \n\nIn an address delivered during his show “Reliable Sources,” Stelter pointed out that the Republican nominee’s attempts to discredit the election system over the last year haven’t received as much attention from reporters recently, as such comments have become par for the course. That, Stelter argues, needs to change.\n\n“[O]ver time, the repetition, Trump’s lies about election rigging have become a form of background noise, more of the same, and this is a propaganda technique, whether Trump knows it or not,” he said. “If you say something often enough, if you plant enough seeds, people start to wonder, ‘Will my vote matter? Will it actually count?’”\n\nAs an example, Stelter pointed to a clip of Trump hinting at voter fraud and crooked polls during a speech in Philadelphia on Monday. That clip was only played once on CNN.\n\n“We as a country cannot allow ourselves to become numb to this,” Stelter urged, noting that there is zero evidence of such fraud. “We as a media cannot shrug it off as old news ... Some of his supporters believe him.”\n\nTrump is encouraging his supporters to act as poll monitors in battleground states, and his efforts to cast doubt on the election system have inspired some supporters to call for a “revolution” if he loses the election on Nov. 8, clips played by Stelter showed. \n\n“Mr. Trump, think of your children,” Stelter concluded. “America is great partly because everyone accepts the results of elections, for decades in the past and hopefully for decades to come. Inventing a conspiracy theory is no way to make America great again.”\nEditor’s note: Donald Trump regularly\nincites\npolitical violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe,\nracist, misogynist and birther who has\nrepeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from\nentering the U.S.",

Malgré tout, Bernadette Chirac est toujours restée fidèle à son mari, au point de se rendre indispensable dans la vie privée et publique de l'ancien président de la République.\n\n\nDans un documentaire consacré à l'ancien chef de l'Etat, diffusé dimanche 16 octobre au soir sur France 2, l'ex-première dame raconte comment elle a réussi à passer outre pour garder son mari auprès d'elle, comme vous pouvez le voir dans la vidéo ci-dessous.\n\nBeaucoup auraient voulu l'avoir, dit-elle. Je me suis blindée, je ne me suis pas laissé avoir, la preuve, c'est que je suis restée et finalement, j'ai gagné.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPourtant, comme l'explique le site Franceinfo, une journaliste \"d'un grand quotidien national\" aurait pu briser le couple. A l'époque Jacques Chirac est Premier ministre. Il tombe amoureux de cette femme et envisage même de quitter Bernadette.\n\n\n\nFinalement, ses amis le persuadent de cesser cette relation \"dans l'intérêt de sa carrière politique\", comme le détaille le site d'informations.\n\n\n\nLire aussi :\n\n\n• Jacques Chirac a quitté l'hôpital et poursuit sa convalescence chez lui\n\n\n• Bernadette Chirac: \"Alain Juppé est très très froid, il n'attire pas les électeurs\"\n\n\n• VIDÉO.

I easily passed him in my vehicle because he was hugging the right side next to the construction, literally walking on the white line that marks the shoulder,” she said in the NAACP’s release. “I have no interest in vilifying the police, but obviously I got out of my car in the first place because I perceive the pedestrian might not get treated fairly because of his ethnicity.”\n\nIn addition to asking for an apology, the NAACP has asked that an outside investigation be conducted into the incident and that the officer be suspended without pay.\n\nThe police department could not immediately be reached for comment Sunday; nor could the man whom the NAACP identified as the person arrested.",

But the debut of sci-fi adventure &ldquo;Max Steel&rdquo; was ignored by moviegoers with $2.1 million at 2,034 screens for a dismal $1,049 per-screen average.</p>\n<p>Warner Bros.&rsquo; &ldquo;The Accountant&rdquo; took in $200,000 more than last weekend&rsquo;s winner, &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/girl-on-the-train-rides-to-the-top-of-the-box-office_us_57fa87d8e4b068ecb5df5e8e\" target=\"_blank\">The Girl on the Train</a>,&rdquo; which opened with $24.5 million. The Emily Blunt thriller finished in a tie for second with&rdquo;Kevin Hart: What Now?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Accountant&rdquo; carries a moderate $40 million price tag with Affleck portraying an autistic math savant and weapons expert who cooks the books for criminal organizations. Gavin O&rsquo;Connor directs from a script by Bill Dubuque. Anna Kendrick, J.K. Simmons, Jon Bernthal, Jeffrey Tambor and John Lithgow also star. Prospects for holdover business are decent with an A CinemaScore, particularly with 86% of customers over 25.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Accountant&rdquo; opened quietly in 10 interational markets with $2.8 million from 1,190 screens, led by $755,000 at 109 sites in Taiwan. It will open next weekend in Brazil, Germany and Spain.</p>\n<p>Warner-based Affleck has a strong track record in dramas with 2010&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Town,&rdquo; which grossed $154 million worldwide; 2012&rsquo;s Best Picture Oscar winner &ldquo;Argo,&rdquo; with $232 million worldwide; and 2014&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gone Girl,&rdquo; with $369 million worldwide. His Prohibition-era crime drama &ldquo;Live by Night&rdquo; opens on Christmas and he&rsquo;ll return as Batman in &ldquo;Justice League&rdquo; on Nov. 17, 2017.</p><div class=\"embed-asset embed\" data-type=\"embed-asset\" data-provider=\"Embed\" data-title=\"\">\n<div class=\"embed-code\"><div class=\"vdb_player vdb_5668ae6ee4b0b5e26955d6a656000e19e4b0e4e194b84b31\" vdb_params=\"m.fwkeyvalues=sponsorship%3DSPONSORSHIP_NAME&amp;m.fwsitesection=composer\"><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=5668ae6ee4b0b5e26955d6a6/vid=57600253e4b0b9b5aae25dc1/56000e19e4b0e4e194b84b31.js\"></script></div></div></div>\n     <p>&ldquo;Kevin Hart: What Now?&rdquo; is a look at the final performance of his most recent comedy tour, filmed in August, 2015, at Philadelphia&rsquo;s Lincoln Financial Field ― and book-ended by James Bond-style spoof sequences in which Hart teams with Halle Berry as his loyal but dismissive associate. Leslie Small and Tim Story directed.</p>\n<p>The concert film is already a money-maker with production costs under $10 million. Hart&rsquo;s a proven performer in this genre with 2013&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain&rdquo; having grossed $32 million domestically.</p>\n<p>Open Road is handling &ldquo;Max Steel,&rdquo; based on Mattel&rsquo;s line of action figures and starring Ben Winchell of MTV&rsquo;s &ldquo;Finding Carter.&rdquo; The film, focuses on the teenage Max McGrath and alien companion Steel, who evolve into the superhero Max Steel.</p>\n<p>Fox&rsquo;s third weekend of &ldquo;Miss Peregrine&rsquo;s Home for Peculiar Children&rdquo; finished fourth with $8.9 million at 3,538 locations, giving the Tim Burton fantasy $65.8 million after 17 days.

    "plain_text": "\n\n     \nLOS ANGELES, Oct 16 (Variety.com) - Underlining Ben Affleck’s star power, “The Accountant” dominated moviegoing with a solid $24.7 million opening weekend at 3,222 North American sites.\n\nSunday’s estimate came in significantly above expectations, which had ranged from $18 million to $20 million at the start of the weekend.\n\nComedy concert film “Kevin Hart: What Now?” delivered about half of “The Accountant” total with $12 million at 2,568 locations. But the debut of sci-fi adventure “Max Steel” was ignored by moviegoers with $2.1 million at 2,034 screens for a dismal $1,049 per-screen average.\n\nWarner Bros.’ “The Accountant” took in $200,000 more than last weekend’s winner, “The Girl on the Train,” which opened with $24.5 million. The Emily Blunt thriller finished in a tie for second with”Kevin Hart: What Now?”\n\n“The Accountant” carries a moderate $40 million price tag with Affleck portraying an autistic math savant and weapons expert who cooks the books for criminal organizations.

    "plain_text": "\n\n     \nAnticipation for a third “Sex and the City” movie has been growing for a while now, though, unfortunately, nothing has come to fruition. On Sunday, however, the series’ star, Sarah Jessica Parker, gave us a little glimmer of hope. \n\nIn an interview with Jane Pauley on CBS’ “Sunday Morning,” Parker revealed, “the idea, it rests in the butler’s pantry. Not on the table, but somebody is holding it fairly nearby.” \n\n“Nearby” sounds promising to us, especially considering the actress said in May that there were “no plans” for another installment of “SATC.”\n\nGiven this new hint, Pauley said to Parker, “One can’t help but picture a ‘Golden Girls’ kind of version of ‘Sex and the City,’ if you’re inclined to be looking back on your lives at all, or are you still looking forward?”\n\n\n\n“I would have sort of imagined that those women have only interest in looking ahead, while being informed by the past,” Parker responded. “And in a way, maybe that would be the best for all of us — living people, nonfictional as well!”\n\nSJP, dishing out the life advice. \n\nYou can watch the whole interview above. \n\n",

The controversial move has angered charter school activists and faced criticism from the editorial boards at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/opinion/a-misguided-attack-on-charter-schools.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-naacp-opposes-charter-schools-maybe-it-should-do-its-homework/2016/10/11/473bbb36-8d75-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html?utm_term=.b647d31fefca\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Post</a>.</p>\n<p>Charter schools are publicly funded but privately operated. Minnesota passed a law creating the first legislated charter school in 1991, and since that time, the number of charter schools has ballooned to about 7,000 all over the country, according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. In recent years, these schools have faced criticism for their sometimes <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/charter-school-suspensions_us_56e9939ee4b0b25c91841ed5\">harsh discipline practices</a>, lack of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-oliver-shows-why-charter-schools-are-not-always-a-great-idea_us_57bb00cae4b03d51368958bf\">oversight and accountability</a>&nbsp;and for <a href=\"http://neatoday.org/2016/01/22/school-choice/\" target=\"_blank\">siphoning resources away</a> from traditional public schools. At the same time, studies have shown that students ― especially disadvantaged students ― who are educated in charter schools&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/25/charter-school-performance-study_n_3493023.html\">make slightly larger gains in reading than their peers</a>, although results vary widely depending on the school and state.</p>\n<p>In late July, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/08/black-lives-matter-naacp-moratorium-charter-schools\" target=\"_blank\">delegates at the NAACP national convention</a> voted on a resolution that calls for a moratorium on the growth of charter schools. On Saturday, the NAACP board ratified this resolution.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The <a href=\"http://www.naacp.org/latest/statement-regarding-naacps-resolution-moratorium-charter-schools/\" target=\"_blank\">NAACP&rsquo;s resolution is not inspired by ideological opposition</a> to charter schools but by our historical support of public schools ― as well as today&rsquo;s data and the present experience of NAACP branches in nearly every school district in the nation,&rdquo; Cornell William Brooks, president and CEO of the NAACP, said in a statement. &ldquo;Our NAACP members, who as citizen advocates, not professional lobbyists, are those who attend school board meetings, engage with state legislatures and support both parents and teachers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In its entirety, the resolution calls for a freeze on the expansion of these schools until charter schools are subject to the same accountability as traditional public schools and develop a funding system that does not hurt other schools.&nbsp;It also calls for charter schools to end harsh discipline practices that push out students and segregate high-performing children &ldquo;from those whose aspirations may be high but whose talents are not yet as obvious.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The resolution suggests that instead of giving students access to charter schools through school choice, policymakers should focus on enhancing the quality of traditional public schools, despite their many shortcomings.&nbsp;Indeed, it is the nation&rsquo;s black and brown children that often bear the brunt of underperforming schools ― whether they be charter or public.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;While we have reservations about charter schools, we recognize that many children attend traditional public schools that are inadequately and inequitably equipped to prepare them for the innovative and competitive environment they will face as adults,&rdquo; says a statement from the NAACP. &ldquo;Underfunded and under-supported, these traditional public schools have much work to do to transform curriculum, prepare teachers, and give students the resources they need to have thriving careers in a technologically advanced society that is changing every year. There is no time to wait. Our children immediately deserve the best education we can provide.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>While the vote received immediate support from teachers unions and some public school groups, education reform organizations have been pushing back against the resolution for months. In September, a group of black leaders sent a letter to the NAACP board members criticizing the proposal. According to the letter, this vote is of particular importance to black children, who are overrepresented in charter schools.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The proposed resolution cites a variety of cherry-picked and debunked claims about charter schools,&rdquo; <a href=\"http://www.publiccharters.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NAACPResponse_FINAL_9212016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">says the letter</a>. &ldquo;In reality, charter schools generally receive less per-pupil funding than traditional district public schools and often receive little or no funding to purchase buildings or maintain classrooms. Despite these hurdles, charter schools are helping students achieve at higher levels than traditional district schools.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>On Saturday, a statement from the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools President and CEO Nina Rees called the policy &ldquo;misguided.&rdquo; Still, Rees said she is encouraged that &ldquo;the <span class=\"il\">NAACP</span> is clear that they are not opposed to charter schools.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Across the country, charter public schools are working for hundreds of thousands of Black families.&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s decision doesn&rsquo;t just ignore the fact that charter schools are working for so many students and families ...&nbsp;It also ignores the thousands of families and Black leaders who have stepped forward over the last two months urging the <span class=\"il\">NAACP</span> to reconsider their decision,&rdquo; Rees said in the statement.</p>\n<p>The president of the nation&rsquo;s largest teachers union, however, praised the vote. Teachers unions have long been critical of charter schools.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The chorus of those of us who have been sounding the alarm on the many long-standing structural and governance problems that have plagued charters in recent years is growing. The time is right to pause and reassess,&rdquo; said a statement from Lily Eskelsen Garc&iacute;a, president of the National Education Association.&nbsp;&ldquo;We strongly support more inclusive and otherwise positive alternatives to charter schools. We should invest in proven strategies &mdash; strategies such as smaller class sizes, parental involvement, magnet and community schools &mdash; that we know help to improve the success of all of our students.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On Twitter, education and civil rights leaders sounded off:</p><div class=\"embed-asset embed\" data-type=\"embed-asset\" data-provider=\"Embed\" data-title=\"\">\n<div class=\"embed-code\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" align=\"center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NAACP\">@NAACP</a> can pass whatever they want.

    "plain_text": "\nThe NAACP board of directors voted Saturday to confirm a resolution that recommends an end to the expansion of charter schools, which currently educate about 6 percent of the nation’s public school students. The controversial move has angered charter school activists and faced criticism from the editorial boards at The New York Times and The Washington Post.\n\nCharter schools are publicly funded but privately operated. Minnesota passed a law creating the first legislated charter school in 1991, and since that time, the number of charter schools has ballooned to about 7,000 all over the country, according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. In recent years, these schools have faced criticism for their sometimes harsh discipline practices, lack of oversight and accountability and for siphoning resources away from traditional public schools. At the same time, studies have shown that students ― especially disadvantaged students ― who are educated in charter schools make slightly larger gains in reading than their peers, although results vary widely depending on the school and state.\n\nIn late July, delegates at the NAACP national convention voted on a resolution that calls for a moratorium on the growth of charter schools. On Saturday, the NAACP board ratified this resolution. \n\n“The NAACP’s resolution is not inspired by ideological opposition to charter schools but by our historical support of public schools ― as well as today’s data and the present experience of NAACP branches in nearly every school district in the nation,” Cornell William Brooks, president and CEO of the NAACP, said in a statement. “Our NAACP members, who as citizen advocates, not professional lobbyists, are those who attend school board meetings, engage with state legislatures and support both parents and teachers.”\n\nIn its entirety, the resolution calls for a freeze on the expansion of these schools until charter schools are subject to the same accountability as traditional public schools and develop a funding system that does not hurt other schools. It also calls for charter schools to end harsh discipline practices that push out students and segregate high-performing children “from those whose aspirations may be high but whose talents are not yet as obvious.”\n\nThe resolution suggests that instead of giving students access to charter schools through school choice, policymakers should focus on enhancing the quality of traditional public schools, despite their many shortcomings. Indeed, it is the nation’s black and brown children that often bear the brunt of underperforming schools ― whether they be charter or public. \n\n“While we have reservations about charter schools, we recognize that many children attend traditional public schools that are inadequately and inequitably equipped to prepare them for the innovative and competitive environment they will face as adults,” says a statement from the NAACP. “Underfunded and under-supported, these traditional public schools have much work to do to transform curriculum, prepare teachers, and give students the resources they need to have thriving careers in a technologically advanced society that is changing every year. There is no time to wait. Our children immediately deserve the best education we can provide.”\n\nWhile the vote received immediate support from teachers unions and some public school groups, education reform organizations have been pushing back against the resolution for months. In September, a group of black leaders sent a letter to the NAACP board members criticizing the proposal. According to the letter, this vote is of particular importance to black children, who are overrepresented in charter schools.\n\n“The proposed resolution cites a variety of cherry-picked and debunked claims about charter schools,” says the letter. “In reality, charter schools generally receive less per-pupil funding than traditional district public schools and often receive little or no funding to purchase buildings or maintain classrooms. Despite these hurdles, charter schools are helping students achieve at higher levels than traditional district schools.”\n\nOn Saturday, a statement from the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools President and CEO Nina Rees called the policy “misguided.” Still, Rees said she is encouraged that “the NAACP is clear that they are not opposed to charter schools.”\n\n“Across the country, charter public schools are working for hundreds of thousands of Black families. Today’s decision doesn’t just ignore the fact that charter schools are working for so many students and families ... It also ignores the thousands of families and Black leaders who have stepped forward over the last two months urging the NAACP to reconsider their decision,” Rees said in the statement.\n\nThe president of the nation’s largest teachers union, however, praised the vote. Teachers unions have long been critical of charter schools. \n\n“The chorus of those of us who have been sounding the alarm on the many long-standing structural and governance problems that have plagued charters in recent years is growing. The time is right to pause and reassess,” said a statement from Lily Eskelsen García, president of the National Education Association. “We strongly support more inclusive and otherwise positive alternatives to charter schools. We should invest in proven strategies — strategies such as smaller class sizes, parental involvement, magnet and community schools — that we know help to improve the success of all of our students.” \n\nOn Twitter, education and civil rights leaders sounded off:\n\nThe @NAACP can pass whatever they want. They won't marginalize the voices of the black people choosing independent public schools.— Citizen Stewart (@citizenstewart) October 15, 2016\n\n     \n\nDon't vilify charters for having higher discipline rates + ignore that discipline rates for black kids are TOO high, period. \n\nBOTH are true— Brittany Packnett (@MsPackyetti) October 15, 2016\n\n     \n\nThe 2d \"A\" in @NAACP stands for Advancement. Try telling that to many thousands of black families now on wait lists for charter schools.— Joel Klein (@JoelIKlein) October 15, 2016\n\n     \n\nOne of these days, people still stop thinking that moratorium is the same as abolition. This convo around the @NAACP lacks serious nuance.— Jose Vilson (@TheJLV) October 15, 2016\n\n     \n\nNo matter what happened yesterday tomorrow millions of our children will show up at charter schools.Our focus MUST be on them. #ChartersWork— Howard Fuller (@HowardLFuller) October 16, 2016\n\n     ",

He wants to be president of the United States of America,&rdquo; Usmani told The Huffington Post on Tuesday, speaking over Skype from Pakistan.</p>\n<p>Bhagwanee landed in Islamabad on Monday with their three sons. Usmani has an apartment there, and it&rsquo;s where they all plan to live now, because America doesn&rsquo;t feel safe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very heartbreaking and sad,&rdquo; said Usmani, twice a Fulbright Scholar and an award-winning computer scientist who uses big data to save lives from terror attacks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the America we know about, care about and want to live in,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p><img src=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset//57fe48ee170000bc16acb647.jpeg\" data-caption=\"The Usmani family at Disney World earlier this year.\" data-credit=\"Courtesy Zeeshanulhassan Usmani\"/><p>Usmani remembers his middle son, 8 years old,&nbsp;being very angry one day after being picked up from school. Apparently his classmates had told him his dad ― a Pakistani man with a beard ―&nbsp;was a terrorist.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He asked me if I was a terrorist,&rdquo; Usmani recalled. After that, Bhagwanee asked him not to go to the school anymore,&nbsp;&ldquo;just so my children would not face any discrimination because of my face.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There was the time Usmani&rsquo;s eldest son, 14,&nbsp;saw a classmate bring a knife into school that his dad had bought in Colombia. When Usmani&rsquo;s son brought a knife into school that his dad had bought in Pakistan, students called him &ldquo;ISIS&rdquo; and &ldquo;terrorist.&rdquo; The school went on lockdown and he was suspended for six months, Usmani said. He added that the experience was traumatic for his son, who&rsquo;s been homeschooled ever since and now suffers from depression and anxiety.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Want all the latest news in politics that matters to you? <a href=\"http://huff.to/2dJSr1B\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up here to get it delivered straight to your inbox</a>.</h4>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Earlier this year, there was the neighbor that constantly harassed them, once calling them &ldquo;motherfuckers&rdquo; and threatening Usmani&rsquo;s wife. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He came to our apartment twice at midnight and at 2:00 AM, passing racial slurs, teaching us how to &lsquo;behave&rsquo; and &ldquo;&rsquo;live in this country,&rsquo; mentioning Donald Trump and his desire to vote for him to kick us out of this country,&rdquo; Usmani wrote in an email to the Cary Police Department in July. (That type of harassment from neighbors is sadly familiar to Muslims or people perceived to be Muslim, and has culminated in the murders of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/19/chapel-hill-muslims-fear_n_6716106.html\">three people in Chapel Hill, North Carolina</a> and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/khalid-jabara-killed_us_57b493b8e4b0b42c38afb448\">one person in Tulsa, Oklahoma</a> in the last two years.)</p>\n<p>The neighbor eventually moved, Usmani said, adding that the local police department was &ldquo;really great&rdquo; in handling the situation.</p>\n<p>In June, a man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/10/army-reserve-officer-threatens-kill-muslims-north-carolina-mosque\" target=\"_blank\">brandished a handgun at the mosque the Usmani family attends</a> in nearby Fayetteville, telling parishioners there that was going to kill them and bury them behind the mosque. The man allegedly behind the threats, Iraq War veteran Russell Thomas Langford, also left packages of bacon outside the mosque, a common insult to Muslims, whose faith forbids them from eating pork. When police arrived and arrested Langford, they found multiple guns inside his truck along with 500 rounds of ammunition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While Usmani&rsquo;s family wasn&rsquo;t at the mosque that day, the event still left them shaken, he said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In September, the Fort Pierce, Florida mosque where Usmani says he used to attend Eid services when he was a student, was&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/orlando-shooter-mosque-fire-arson_us_57d6ab84e4b00642712e497b\">set on fire</a>. The alleged arsonist, <a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/florida/fl-fort-pierce-mosque-fire-update-20160914-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Screiber</a>, had made <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100006919518144&amp;fref=ts\" target=\"_blank\">anti-Muslim and pro-Trump Facebook posts</a> in the months leading up to the attack.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All that happened in just the last year.</p>\n<p>Over the course of that year,&nbsp;the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump, proposed a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-evolution-of-trumps-proposed-muslim-ban_us_57fbf1cde4b068ecb5e0edb5?fwopxwsv97ickrzfr\">ban on Muslims</a> entering the U.S., called for the creation of a <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-says-he-would-certainly-implement-muslim-database-n466716\" target=\"_blank\">national database of Muslims</a>, said that mosques should be <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-mosque-surveillance_us_576462a0e4b0853f8bf0f5d5\">surveilled</a> and Muslims should be <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/06/19/donald-trump-calls-profiling-muslims-common-sense/\" target=\"_blank\">profiled</a>, told an <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-cites-dubious-legend-about-gen-pershi/\" target=\"_blank\">apocryphal story about shooting Muslims with bullets dipped in pig blood</a>, suggested that the Muslim mother of a fallen American soldier <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/us/politics/donald-trump-khizr-khan-wife-ghazala.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">wasn&rsquo;t allowed to speak</a>&nbsp;at the Democratic National Convention because of her faith and said: &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/09/politics/donald-trump-islam-hates-us/\" target=\"_blank\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:27,&quot;plid&quot;:&quot;politics/donald-trump-islam-hates-us/&quot;}}\">Islam hates us</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Anti-Muslim hate crimes have surged nationwide.

Lisa Luten, a spokeswoman for Wake County Public School System, said Principal Tim Chadwick immediately launched an investigation into the alleged attack, but said that initial interviews with other students and the bus driver didn&rsquo;t corroborate Abdul Aziz&rsquo;s version of events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No students on the bus, nor the bus driver, reported seeing an altercation, Luten said.&nbsp;One student, however, did remember seeing&nbsp;&ldquo;play-fighting&rdquo; on the bus.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Luten also said the Usmani family did not report that students made references to Islam, Muslims and Pakistan, as the <a href=\"https://www.cair.com/press-center/press-releases/13814-cair-calls-for-probe-of-north-carolina-school-bus-assault-on-muslim-7-year-old.html\" target=\"_blank\">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> said they did in a Monday press release.</p>\n<p>But in an email Usmani sent to Chadwick early Tuesday, he explained that he had talked to Abdul Aziz &ldquo;in detail&rdquo; about the alleged attack.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The kids who beat him up mentioned Muslims, makes fun of his name starts with Abdul and reference his preference of eating only certain (halal) food,&rdquo; Usmani wrote. &ldquo;My son is very traumatized and shocked as he has just celebrated his birthday with his classmates few days ago.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Luten, the spokeswoman, emphasized that the school&rsquo;s investigation is ongoing and that the principal wants to interview the Usmani family.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The behavior alleged in this complaint is not tolerated in our schools,&rdquo; Luten said.&nbsp;&ldquo;We have policies that specifically prohibit bullying. Any incident that is brought to our attention is fully investigated.&rdquo;</p><img src=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset//57fe4aac1b0000df1cef67dd.jpeg\" data-caption=\"Zeeshan-ul-hassan Usmani at Brown University in 2014, while he was a visiting scholar at the&amp;nbsp;Watson Institute of International Studies.\" data-credit=\"Courtesy Zeeshan-ul-hassan Usmani\"/><p>Usmani said his family had planned on moving out of Cary anyway, perhaps to Berkeley, California, where his current employer is based. But after what happened to Abdul Aziz on the school bus, Bhagwanee decided it was time to go back to Pakistan.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Usmani said there was an irony in having to get his two youngest sons ― both of whom were born in America and are U.S.&nbsp;citizens ―&nbsp;visas to get into Pakistan.</p>\n<p>And still more ironic,&nbsp;after a year of such anti-Muslim vitriol, is the award-winning <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/zusmani\" target=\"_blank\">work</a> Usmani does to protect people from terror attacks around the world. Formerly the chief technology officer of the data company PredictifyMe,&nbsp;he&rsquo;s used big data to help better understand who in Europe and the U.S. is <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/12/15/news/economy/isis-recruit-characteristics/\" target=\"_blank\">vulnerable to being recruited by ISIS</a>. And in a <a href=\"http://educationenvoy.org/press-release/\" target=\"_blank\">collaboration with the United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education</a>, he&rsquo;s developed software that models the damage of suicide bombings, in an effort to protect schools and other buildings in Pakistan,&nbsp;Sudan, Nigeria, and Syria from terror attacks.</p>\n<p>His 21-page resume lists two Fulbright scholarships, an Eisenhower fellowship, four degrees including a Ph.D., visiting professorships across the world, a slew of awards and links to profiles of his work in the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704269204575270642793226102\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/26/smallbusiness/predictifyme-school-bombings/\" target=\"_blank\">CNN</a>&nbsp;and many other major news outlets.</p>\n<p>While his family stays in Islamabad, Usmani, because of his work,&nbsp;will have to split his time between Pakistan and the U.S., he said. He also said his family would consider moving back to the U.S. if Donald Trump loses the election next month.&nbsp;They would &ldquo;absolutely&rdquo; feel safer in the U.S. if Trump loses, Usmani said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That said, Pakistan hasn&rsquo;t always been safe for the Usmani family either.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 2013, Usmani was part of a team that won the <a href=\"http://islamabad.tie.org/2458/\" target=\"_blank\">TiE StartUp Cup Pakistan</a>, a business model competition organized by StartUp Cup USA with TiE and the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;On our way back from the competition, we got robbed,&rdquo; Usmani wrote in an email to friends and colleagues at the time. &ldquo;They were 9 <a href=\"https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/dacoit\" target=\"_blank\">Dacoits</a>, they beat me up very badly, beat my wife and 10 years old son and took away all the cash, mobiles, laptop, camera, all debit/credit cards everything. So now I have a lazy eye, injured rib, and few less teeth.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Usmani told HuffPost he believes he and his family were attacked because of his counter-terror work.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a very interesting dilemma,&rdquo; he said, noting that his work against ISIS and terrorists around the world makes him feel unsafe when he&rsquo;s in Islamabad. But the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/islamophobia/\">Islamophobia</a> in the U.S. has also made him concerned for his and his family&rsquo;s well-being, he said.</p>\n<p>He added, &ldquo;I guess I can&rsquo;t live anywhere in world.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>The Huffington Post is documenting the rising wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and violence in America. <a href=\"http://testkitchen.huffingtonpost.com/islamophobia/\">Take a stand</a> against hate.</em></p>",

    "plain_text": "\nUPDATE: Oct. 16 ― The Cary Police Dept. and the Wake County School System say they have not found any evidence to corroborate Zeeshan-ul-hassan Usmani’s claim that his son was assaulted aboard a school bus on Oct. 7. “Our police department has been coordinating with the school system to uncover details related to this matter,” Town Manager Sean Stegall said in a statement. “At this time, nothing has been found, and no police report has been filed.” In a letter to parents with children at Weatherstone Elementary School, Principal Tim Chadwick wrote that information from an investigation “does not support an altercation.” He added, “No students who were interviewed witnessed an altercation. The bus driver did not witness an altercation. The child did not report to the bus driver any injury.” \n\nPREVIOUSLY:\n\n“I’m done with the U.S.,” Zeeshan-ul-hassan Usmani’s wife told him on Friday.\n\nSeeing her youngest son, just 7 years old, walk off the school bus bruised and battered that afternoon outside their apartment building in Cary, North Carolina, was the final straw. \n\n     \nLittle Abdul Aziz, a first-grader and the youngest child of Usmani and Binish Bhagwanee, was traumatized. He told his parents a classmate had tried to force him to eat food that wasn’t halal. When Abdul Aziz refused, five of his classmates ganged up on him, making fun of his name. They punched him in the face, kicked him in the stomach, and twisted his arm while calling him “Muslim” again and again, Usmani said.\n\n“He was born and raised [in the United States]. He was born in Florida. As American as you can think of. He likes Captain America. He wants to be president of the United States of America,” Usmani told The Huffington Post on Tuesday, speaking over Skype from Pakistan.\n\nBhagwanee landed in Islamabad on Monday with their three sons. Usmani has an apartment there, and it’s where they all plan to live now, because America doesn’t feel safe. \n\n“It’s very heartbreaking and sad,” said Usmani, twice a Fulbright Scholar and an award-winning computer scientist who uses big data to save lives from terror attacks. \n\n“It’s not the America we know about, care about and want to live in,” he said. \nUsmani remembers his middle son, 8 years old, being very angry one day after being picked up from school. Apparently his classmates had told him his dad ― a Pakistani man with a beard ― was a terrorist.\n\n“He asked me if I was a terrorist,” Usmani recalled. After that, Bhagwanee asked him not to go to the school anymore, “just so my children would not face any discrimination because of my face.” \n\nThere was the time Usmani’s eldest son, 14, saw a classmate bring a knife into school that his dad had bought in Colombia. When Usmani’s son brought a knife into school that his dad had bought in Pakistan, students called him “ISIS” and “terrorist.” The school went on lockdown and he was suspended for six months, Usmani said. He added that the experience was traumatic for his son, who’s been homeschooled ever since and now suffers from depression and anxiety.\n\nWant all the latest news in politics that matters to you? Sign up here to get it delivered straight to your inbox.\n\n\nEarlier this year, there was the neighbor that constantly harassed them, once calling them “motherfuckers” and threatening Usmani’s wife.  \n\n“He came to our apartment twice at midnight and at 2:00 AM, passing racial slurs, teaching us how to ‘behave’ and “’live in this country,’ mentioning Donald Trump and his desire to vote for him to kick us out of this country,” Usmani wrote in an email to the Cary Police Department in July. (That type of harassment from neighbors is sadly familiar to Muslims or people perceived to be Muslim, and has culminated in the murders of three people in Chapel Hill, North Carolina and one person in Tulsa, Oklahoma in the last two years.)\n\nThe neighbor eventually moved, Usmani said, adding that the local police department was “really great” in handling the situation.\n\nIn June, a man brandished a handgun at the mosque the Usmani family attends in nearby Fayetteville, telling parishioners there that was going to kill them and bury them behind the mosque. The man allegedly behind the threats, Iraq War veteran Russell Thomas Langford, also left packages of bacon outside the mosque, a common insult to Muslims, whose faith forbids them from eating pork. When police arrived and arrested Langford, they found multiple guns inside his truck along with 500 rounds of ammunition. \n\nWhile Usmani’s family wasn’t at the mosque that day, the event still left them shaken, he said. \n\nIn September, the Fort Pierce, Florida mosque where Usmani says he used to attend Eid services when he was a student, was set on fire. The alleged arsonist, Joseph Screiber, had made anti-Muslim and pro-Trump Facebook posts in the months leading up to the attack. \n\nAll that happened in just the last year.\n\nOver the course of that year, the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump, proposed a ban on Muslims entering the U.S., called for the creation of a national database of Muslims, said that mosques should be surveilled and Muslims should be profiled, told an apocryphal story about shooting Muslims with bullets dipped in pig blood, suggested that the Muslim mother of a fallen American soldier wasn’t allowed to speak at the Democratic National Convention because of her faith and said: “Islam hates us.”\n\nAnti-Muslim hate crimes have surged nationwide. A recent report from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at the California State University, San Bernardino, documented at least 260 hate crimes targeting Muslims in 2015 ― a nearly 80 percent rise from 2014 and the highest annual number of such crimes since 2001. \n\nSo far in 2016, The Huffington Post has documented nearly 290 acts of anti-Muslim violence, discrimination and political speech in the U.S. \nAfter Abdul Aziz walked off the school bus Friday, Usmani said he and Bhagwanee reported the incident to the school. Lisa Luten, a spokeswoman for Wake County Public School System, said Principal Tim Chadwick immediately launched an investigation into the alleged attack, but said that initial interviews with other students and the bus driver didn’t corroborate Abdul Aziz’s version of events.  \n\nNo students on the bus, nor the bus driver, reported seeing an altercation, Luten said. One student, however, did remember seeing “play-fighting” on the bus. \n\nLuten also said the Usmani family did not report that students made references to Islam, Muslims and Pakistan, as the Council on American-Islamic Relations said they did in a Monday press release.\n\nBut in an email Usmani sent to Chadwick early Tuesday, he explained that he had talked to Abdul Aziz “in detail” about the alleged attack.\n\n“The kids who beat him up mentioned Muslims, makes fun of his name starts with Abdul and reference his preference of eating only certain (halal) food,” Usmani wrote. “My son is very traumatized and shocked as he has just celebrated his birthday with his classmates few days ago.”\n\nLuten, the spokeswoman, emphasized that the school’s investigation is ongoing and that the principal wants to interview the Usmani family. \n\n“The behavior alleged in this complaint is not tolerated in our schools,” Luten said. “We have policies that specifically prohibit bullying. Any incident that is brought to our attention is fully investigated.”\nUsmani said his family had planned on moving out of Cary anyway, perhaps to Berkeley, California, where his current employer is based. But after what happened to Abdul Aziz on the school bus, Bhagwanee decided it was time to go back to Pakistan. \n\nUsmani said there was an irony in having to get his two youngest sons ― both of whom were born in America and are U.S. citizens ― visas to get into Pakistan.\n\nAnd still more ironic, after a year of such anti-Muslim vitriol, is the award-winning work Usmani does to protect people from terror attacks around the world. Formerly the chief technology officer of the data company PredictifyMe, he’s used big data to help better understand who in Europe and the U.S. is vulnerable to being recruited by ISIS. And in a collaboration with the United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education, he’s developed software that models the damage of suicide bombings, in an effort to protect schools and other buildings in Pakistan, Sudan, Nigeria, and Syria from terror attacks.\n\nHis 21-page resume lists two Fulbright scholarships, an Eisenhower fellowship, four degrees including a Ph.D., visiting professorships across the world, a slew of awards and links to profiles of his work in the Wall Street Journal, CNN and many other major news outlets.\n\nWhile his family stays in Islamabad, Usmani, because of his work, will have to split his time between Pakistan and the U.S., he said. He also said his family would consider moving back to the U.S. if Donald Trump loses the election next month. They would “absolutely” feel safer in the U.S. if Trump loses, Usmani said. \n\nThat said, Pakistan hasn’t always been safe for the Usmani family either. \n\nIn 2013, Usmani was part of a team that won the TiE StartUp Cup Pakistan, a business model competition organized by StartUp Cup USA with TiE and the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan.  \n\n“On our way back from the competition, we got robbed,” Usmani wrote in an email to friends and colleagues at the time. “They were 9 Dacoits, they beat me up very badly, beat my wife and 10 years old son and took away all the cash, mobiles, laptop, camera, all debit/credit cards everything. So now I have a lazy eye, injured rib, and few less teeth.”\n\nUsmani told HuffPost he believes he and his family were attacked because of his counter-terror work. \n\n“I’m in a very interesting dilemma,” he said, noting that his work against ISIS and terrorists around the world makes him feel unsafe when he’s in Islamabad. But the Islamophobia in the U.S. has also made him concerned for his and his family’s well-being, he said.\n\nHe added, “I guess I can’t live anywhere in world.”\n\nThe Huffington Post is documenting the rising wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and violence in America.

    "content": "<p>Dear <em>New York Times</em>:</p>\n<p>Maybe we should have let it go, like we&rsquo;ve done many times before ― turned our other brown cheek. E.J. just woke up in Seattle; the rest of us were beginning our work days on the East Coast. All of us were expecting to go through a normal Friday. Then we saw that you just posted a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000004706646/thisis2016-asian-americans-respond.html\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> to accompany Michael Luo&rsquo;s powerful <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F10%2F10%2Fnyregion%2Fto-the-woman-who-told-my-family-to-go-back-to-china.html%3F_r%3D0\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> about a <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/politicians-asian-americans-respond-after-new-york-times-editor-told-n663746\" target=\"_blank\">racist encounter</a> he had and the very much-needed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/thisis2016?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag\" target=\"_blank\">#thisis2016</a> hashtag it inspired. We got excited! We watched the same video showing a gaggle of people talk about the &ldquo;Asian American&rdquo; experience.</p>\n<p>And we were, honestly, stunned. Your video told us, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still invisible!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>You did this during <a href=\"http://fanhs-national.org/filam/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Filipino American History Month</a> ― the month when we are supposed to be most proud of our brown presence in the U.S.</p>\n<p>And you did this during election season ― when xenophobia against South Asians is on the rise and Islamophobia is so <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/hate-crime-charges-filed-attack-california-sikh-man-n666651\" target=\"_blank\">overt</a> that Muslim Americans (and South Asian Americans who are presumed to be Muslim) expect to be <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/young-adults-speak-out-about-encountering-islamophobia-n649531\" target=\"_blank\">discriminated</a> in their everyday lives.</p><img src=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset//58027b6d1700000116acc2ea.jpg\" data-caption=\"\" data-credit=\"Kevin Nadal\"/><p>We hesitated for a second and then hustled to confront you. We pulled out our smartphones and started commenting on your social media posts, questioning why seemingly 96% of the stories shared were East Asian or non-Brown Asian stories. It was comical, in retrospect, because you probably don&rsquo;t even read comments on social media. But the pain you inflicted on us with your continued disregard is real. It clearly tells us, once again, that we are unseen, unheard, and unappreciated in this country.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are a part of this country!&rdquo; We yelled back.</p>\n<p>It felt silly. But how else to prove we belonged?</p>\n<p>This was not our first encounter, of course, with marginalization &ndash; even among Asian Americans. Ask any Filipino American or South Asian &ndash; or anyone who is not Chinese, Korean or Japanese &ndash; and they&rsquo;ll readily summon memories of repeated attempts to explain why we are not &ldquo;yellow,&rdquo; or disturbing encounters on the street, grocery store, airport, and anywhere really, because our brown skin activates <a href=\"http://saalt.org/category/blog/hate-crimes/\" target=\"_blank\">different kinds</a> of <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260125855_Racial_Microaggressions_and_the_Filipino_American_Experience_Recommendations_for_Counseling_and_Development\" target=\"_blank\">stereotypes</a> in this country.</p>\n<p>This was not even our <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/unseen-and-unheard/201604/why-are-filipino-americans-still-forgotten-and-invisible\" target=\"_blank\">first encounter</a> with <a href=\"http://www.fromthesquare.org/stop-forgetting-filipino-americans/\" target=\"_blank\">you</a>, as over the past six months you have released <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000004308529/a-conversation-with-asians-on-race.html\" target=\"_blank\">two videos</a> about the &ldquo;Asian American&rdquo; experience. Combined, both videos showed the stories of 37 Asian Americans, but only one (3%) was a Filipino story, at a time when Filipinos compose 20% of the <a href=\"http://aapidata.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/AAPIData-CAP-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Asian American population</a>. And only five out of the 37 (13.5%) seemed to be South Asian stories with the most recent video not having any South Asian at all, at a time when South Asians also compose 20% of the Asian American population. In fact, we&rsquo;re so tired of being forgotten that there has been a few times when <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-we-celebrate-filipino-american-history-month_us_57f564a7e4b087a29a54856a\" target=\"_blank\">we took it upon ourselves</a> to have <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/young-adults-speak-out-about-encountering-islamophobia-n649531\" target=\"_blank\">our stories</a> be heard.</p><img src=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset//5801bbdf1a000024055b9a21.jpg\" data-caption=\"Filipinos and Asian Indians are disproportionately underrepresented in New York Times articles.\" data-credit=\"Anthony Ocampo\"/><p>Sure, there are some efforts to better address this great diversity within the large Asian Pacific Islander umbrella, like the progress toward <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/07/27/significance-data-disaggregation-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-aapi-community\" target=\"_blank\">disaggregating</a> data so that we can better understand the issues facing our communities.</p>\n<p>But for some reason &mdash; and, yes, it probably has to do with the political climate right now that makes brown-skinned people, <a href=\"http://thenewpress.com/books/we-too-sing-america\" target=\"_blank\">especially &ldquo;foreign-looking&rdquo; ones with &ldquo;weird names&rdquo; and who are not Christians</a>, very vulnerable &mdash; this time felt different.</p>\n<p>A few hours later, after thinking about it some more, a pang of sadness welled up inside us.</p>\n<p>You are in New York City where there&rsquo;s no shortage of Brown Asians. You have enough resources to make it happen. You have highly-educated staff. You seemed, well, informed. But yet you still don&rsquo;t see us, and, the reality is, neither do many in this country right now.</p>\n<p>Maybe you don&rsquo;t know this, but the continued failure to include us whenever you talk about &ldquo;Asian Americans&rdquo; is extremely insulting, degrading, and oppressive. It gets to the heart of the invisibility that Brown Asians experience. As Michael Luo stated, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this persistent sense of otherness that a lot of us struggle with every day,&rdquo; but we also feel this marginalization within the Asian American community! That even though we compose more than half of the <a href=\"http://aapidata.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/AAPIData-CAP-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Asian Pacific Islander population</a>, even though we have been in these lands now called the United States since <a href=\"http://fanhs-national.org/filam/resolution/\" target=\"_blank\">1587</a>, and even though many of us trace our roots back to lands that are affected by <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Brown-Skin-White-Minds-Postcolonial/dp/1623962072\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. colonialism and imperialism</a>, we still don&rsquo;t belong. We&rsquo;re still forgotten. We&rsquo;re still not Asian American, let alone American. It&rsquo;s one of the reasons many Brown Asians <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804797544/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=KTZWQEVJK5T5HW136VW5\" target=\"_blank\">do not identify</a> as Asian Americans. Perhaps we just don&rsquo;t feel connected to East Asian people, cultures, and lived realities. Perhaps we also don&rsquo;t feel welcomed and included.</p>\n<p>Once again, we feel like outsiders &ndash; even within the Asian American community.</p>\n<p>And we wonder if that feeling will ever go away. Perhaps, more important, we wonder whether future generations of Brown Asians will always feel that way too.</p>\n<p>E.J.&rsquo;s 7-year-old son, who also watched the video, observed, &ldquo;Those people don&rsquo;t look like you, Dad. They don&rsquo;t look like us.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>No, they don&rsquo;t, and although there are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F10%2F10%2Fnyregion%2Fto-the-woman-who-told-my-family-to-go-back-to-china.html%3F_r%3D0\" target=\"_blank\">similarities</a> &ndash; our experiences are very different. E.J. tried to explain why you might have forgotten to include Brown Asians and why we matter. Dr. Karthick Ramakrishnan tried to explain this <a href=\"http://aapidata.com/blog/south-asians-thisis2016/\" target=\"_blank\">too</a>.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re Asian Americans, E.J. said, at least that&rsquo;s what society tells us. But, even though this is 2016, people still don&rsquo;t understand that #BrownAsiansExist.</p>\n<p>I hope you do now.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>E.J.R.

    "plain_text": "\nDear New York Times:\n\nMaybe we should have let it go, like we’ve done many times before ― turned our other brown cheek. E.J. just woke up in Seattle; the rest of us were beginning our work days on the East Coast. All of us were expecting to go through a normal Friday. Then we saw that you just posted a video to accompany Michael Luo’s powerful letter about a racist encounter he had and the very much-needed #thisis2016 hashtag it inspired. We got excited! We watched the same video showing a gaggle of people talk about the “Asian American” experience.\n\nAnd we were, honestly, stunned. Your video told us, “You’re still invisible!”\n\nYou did this during Filipino American History Month ― the month when we are supposed to be most proud of our brown presence in the U.S.\n\nAnd you did this during election season ― when xenophobia against South Asians is on the rise and Islamophobia is so overt that Muslim Americans (and South Asian Americans who are presumed to be Muslim) expect to be discriminated in their everyday lives.\nWe hesitated for a second and then hustled to confront you. We pulled out our smartphones and started commenting on your social media posts, questioning why seemingly 96% of the stories shared were East Asian or non-Brown Asian stories. It was comical, in retrospect, because you probably don’t even read comments on social media. But the pain you inflicted on us with your continued disregard is real. It clearly tells us, once again, that we are unseen, unheard, and unappreciated in this country.\n\n“We are a part of this country!” We yelled back.\n\nIt felt silly. But how else to prove we belonged?\n\nThis was not our first encounter, of course, with marginalization – even among Asian Americans. Ask any Filipino American or South Asian – or anyone who is not Chinese, Korean or Japanese – and they’ll readily summon memories of repeated attempts to explain why we are not “yellow,” or disturbing encounters on the street, grocery store, airport, and anywhere really, because our brown skin activates different kinds of stereotypes in this country.\n\nThis was not even our first encounter with you, as over the past six months you have released two videos about the “Asian American” experience. Combined, both videos showed the stories of 37 Asian Americans, but only one (3%) was a Filipino story, at a time when Filipinos compose 20% of the Asian American population. And only five out of the 37 (13.5%) seemed to be South Asian stories with the most recent video not having any South Asian at all, at a time when South Asians also compose 20% of the Asian American population. In fact, we’re so tired of being forgotten that there has been a few times when we took it upon ourselves to have our stories be heard.\nSure, there are some efforts to better address this great diversity within the large Asian Pacific Islander umbrella, like the progress toward disaggregating data so that we can better understand the issues facing our communities.\n\nBut for some reason — and, yes, it probably has to do with the political climate right now that makes brown-skinned people, especially “foreign-looking” ones with “weird names” and who are not Christians, very vulnerable — this time felt different.\n\nA few hours later, after thinking about it some more, a pang of sadness welled up inside us.\n\nYou are in New York City where there’s no shortage of Brown Asians. You have enough resources to make it happen. You have highly-educated staff. You seemed, well, informed. But yet you still don’t see us, and, the reality is, neither do many in this country right now.\n\nMaybe you don’t know this, but the continued failure to include us whenever you talk about “Asian Americans” is extremely insulting, degrading, and oppressive. It gets to the heart of the invisibility that Brown Asians experience. As Michael Luo stated, “It’s this persistent sense of otherness that a lot of us struggle with every day,” but we also feel this marginalization within the Asian American community! That even though we compose more than half of the Asian Pacific Islander population, even though we have been in these lands now called the United States since 1587, and even though many of us trace our roots back to lands that are affected by U.S. colonialism and imperialism, we still don’t belong. We’re still forgotten. We’re still not Asian American, let alone American. It’s one of the reasons many Brown Asians do not identify as Asian Americans. Perhaps we just don’t feel connected to East Asian people, cultures, and lived realities. Perhaps we also don’t feel welcomed and included.\n\nOnce again, we feel like outsiders – even within the Asian American community.\n\nAnd we wonder if that feeling will ever go away. Perhaps, more important, we wonder whether future generations of Brown Asians will always feel that way too.\n\nE.J.’s 7-year-old son, who also watched the video, observed, “Those people don’t look like you, Dad. They don’t look like us.”\n\nNo, they don’t, and although there are similarities – our experiences are very different. E.J. tried to explain why you might have forgotten to include Brown Asians and why we matter. Dr. Karthick Ramakrishnan tried to explain this too.\n\nWe’re Asian Americans, E.J. said, at least that’s what society tells us. But, even though this is 2016, people still don’t understand that #BrownAsiansExist.\n\nI hope you do now.\n\nSincerely,\n\nE.J.R.

I was invited to present from my research on American Evangelicalism, and when we got to the topic of Donald Trump I found myself befuddled to explain what it is that Evangelicals have found appealing about that noxious, philandering, bigoted blowhard. The sad reality, as I&rsquo;ve <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matthew-d-taylor/donald-trump-embodies-wha_b_9287596.html\" target=\"_blank\">written about before</a>, is that the Religious Right, the self-styled Moral Majority, has lined up behind Trump this year with inexplicably little trouble.</p>\n<p>Growing up in the Evangelical movement, I was constantly warned by pastors and leaders against the danger of becoming a &ldquo;cultural Christian,&rdquo; a person who bore the outward trappings of Christian faith but who did not possess a sincere, personal piety. Evangelicals cast themselves as real Christians who were willing to risk being counter-cultural. What Trump has exposed is that there is such a thing as &ldquo;cultural Evangelicals,&rdquo; a host of people who know the shibboleths of Evangelicalism but can still stomach voting for a man who is the antithesis of Evangelical Christian theology and values. Trump is unrepentantly wicked, a constant liar, a serial adulterer, a self-confessed sexual abuser whose rampant aggression against women has been confirmed this past week by a chorus of female victims who have been unlucky enough to encounter the shameless, treacherous man in the past few decades.</p>\n<p>Evangelical support for Trump ostensibly <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2016/07/13/evangelicals-rally-to-trump-religious-nones-back-clinton/\" target=\"_blank\">peaked in July at 78%</a> and has declined some since, but <a href=\"http://www.prri.org/research/prri-atlantic-october-11-2016-presidential-election-horserace-clinton-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">nearly two thirds of white Evangelicals</a> say they are still supporting Trump. And this is <em>after</em> the video recently surfaced of Trump bragging about using his celebrity status to molest female strangers. Evangelicals have designated themselves as Values Voters, a name entirely belied by that one statistic. Moreover, Governor Mike Pence, Trump&rsquo;s acclaimed Evangelical running mate has bent over backwards to make Trump digestible to his fellow Bible believers, saying they should <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/10/12/mike-pence-liberty-trump-forgive/91948768/\" target=\"_blank\">forgive Trump&rsquo;s abusive tendencies</a> despite Trump&rsquo;s continued patterns of hateful and misogynistic speech.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to forget that just four years ago, the Evangelical voter bloc <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/07/election-2012-post-mortem-white-evangelicals-and-support-for-romney/\" target=\"_blank\">struggled to coalesce</a> around Republican candidate Mitt Romney, a man whose personal integrity, ability to keep his marriage vows, and earnest faith were never in question. You see, Romney is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, he&rsquo;s a Mormon, and Evangelicals have long viewed Mormons as faux Christians and theological heretics who follow Joseph Smith rather than Jesus Christ. On closer examination, much of the bad blood between Evangelicals and Mormons might stem from how similar they are: both Mormonism and Evangelicalism are culturally conservative, politically active, proselytizing movements whose ethos was shaped in the wave of 19th-century American revivalism that historians call the Second Great Awakening.</p>\n<p>This year Mitt Romney has been one of the clarion voices in the conservative movement who has consistently pointed out the danger of Trump. He has called out <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/full-transcript-mitt-romneys-remarks-on-donald-trump-and-the-2016-race-220176\" target=\"_blank\">Trump&rsquo;s foreign policy idiocy, his lies, his moral vacancy, and his existential threat to the American republic</a>. Romney has demonstrated a level of courage and principle that so many Republican elected officials and partisans have lacked.</p>\n<p>But while Romney&rsquo;s principled stance has been lonely within the cowardly elite circles of the Republican Party, he has not been alone. His fellow Mormons have expressed in polls and in statements their revulsion for Trumpism. In a survey this past week among Utah Mormons <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/13/donald-trumps-very-bad-mormon-problem-explained/\" target=\"_blank\">only 38% said they were supporting Trump</a>, with a higher percentage of them saying they have an unfavorable view of Trump than of the perennially unpopular Hillary Clinton. In our hyper-partisan times, a Republican candidate getting only 38% of the Utah Mormon vote is a veritable castigation. And if my Mormon friends are any sort of representative sample, the community&rsquo;s distaste for Trump is deep-seated and rooted in righteousness.</p>\n<p>Mormons, like Evangelicals, have a strong commitment to international missions, leading them to rebuff Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;America first&rdquo; nationalism that would alienate the rest of the globe. Mormons have also repudiated Trump&rsquo;s scapegoating of Latino immigrants and refugees. As a religious minority who has faced more than their share of persecution in America, they are acutely aware of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/us/politics/mormons-trump-utah.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">the peril of Trump&rsquo;s anti-Muslim stances</a>. In short, Mormons have chosen to look beyond the immediate political interests and historical alignments of their own community in this election and see Trump for the evil that he and his campaign are.</p>\n<p>Mormons have gone so far as to put up as a presidential candidate one of their own, a heretofore unknown named Evan McMullin, as a faithful alternative to Trump. Just this past week, McMullin pulled into striking range of both Trump and Clinton in Utah polls, and while his potential for winning the White House is <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-evan-mcmullin-could-win-utah-and-the-presidency/\" target=\"_blank\">virtually nil</a>, he has given Mormons someone for whom they can conscientiously vote without holding their noses. In just about every way imaginable the Mormon community has resisted Trump, Trumpism, and the odious sorts of political bargain-with-the-devil dealmaking to which a solid majority of white Evangelicals have succumbed.</p>\n<p>Of course, a number of Evangelical leaders and voices have spoken out against Trump. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/10/09/if-donald-trump-has-done-anything-he-has-snuffed-out-the-religious-right/\" target=\"_blank\">Russell Moore</a>, <a href=\"http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/october-web-only/speak-truth-to-trump.html?start=3\" target=\"_blank\">Christianity Today</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/donald-trump-a-declaration-by-american-evangelicals-concerning-donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\">growing ensemble of non-white Evangelicals</a> have told the truth about what Trump is and what he represents. But they are shouting into the wind of Evangelical support for Trump, including from many of the guiding lights of the Moral Majority like <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/441069/donald-trump-evangelical-support-weakens-key-figures-stay-loyal\" target=\"_blank\">Jerry Falwell Jr., James Dobson, and Ralph Reed</a>. A pretty good rule of thumb: when you find yourself marching in lock step with the likes of David Duke, the Alt Right, and other out and out racists, you have forsaken the right to tout your morality.</p>\n<p>If the test of the moral courage of a religious movement is how they stand for their values when there is an opportunity to abandon them for political expediency, then Mormons have passed the test thus far in 2016. They have been the Moral Minority. They are the Daniels, the Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednegos, the Esthers of this election season, who have refused the idolatry and apostasy that Trump embodies in his gilded insanity. While Evangelicals may still quibble with Mormons about theology and scripture and history, they should take a lesson from Mormons&rsquo; righteous backbone while there is still time.</p>",

    "plain_text": "\nOne of the most difficult academic presentations I’ve been asked to give this year was before a group of Moroccan Muslim scholars who were visiting Washington, DC this summer to learn about American religion. I was invited to present from my research on American Evangelicalism, and when we got to the topic of Donald Trump I found myself befuddled to explain what it is that Evangelicals have found appealing about that noxious, philandering, bigoted blowhard. The sad reality, as I’ve written about before, is that the Religious Right, the self-styled Moral Majority, has lined up behind Trump this year with inexplicably little trouble.\n\nGrowing up in the Evangelical movement, I was constantly warned by pastors and leaders against the danger of becoming a “cultural Christian,” a person who bore the outward trappings of Christian faith but who did not possess a sincere, personal piety. Evangelicals cast themselves as real Christians who were willing to risk being counter-cultural. What Trump has exposed is that there is such a thing as “cultural Evangelicals,” a host of people who know the shibboleths of Evangelicalism but can still stomach voting for a man who is the antithesis of Evangelical Christian theology and values. Trump is unrepentantly wicked, a constant liar, a serial adulterer, a self-confessed sexual abuser whose rampant aggression against women has been confirmed this past week by a chorus of female victims who have been unlucky enough to encounter the shameless, treacherous man in the past few decades.\n\nEvangelical support for Trump ostensibly peaked in July at 78% and has declined some since, but nearly two thirds of white Evangelicals say they are still supporting Trump. And this is after the video recently surfaced of Trump bragging about using his celebrity status to molest female strangers. Evangelicals have designated themselves as Values Voters, a name entirely belied by that one statistic. Moreover, Governor Mike Pence, Trump’s acclaimed Evangelical running mate has bent over backwards to make Trump digestible to his fellow Bible believers, saying they should forgive Trump’s abusive tendencies despite Trump’s continued patterns of hateful and misogynistic speech.\n\nIt’s easy to forget that just four years ago, the Evangelical voter bloc struggled to coalesce around Republican candidate Mitt Romney, a man whose personal integrity, ability to keep his marriage vows, and earnest faith were never in question. You see, Romney is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, he’s a Mormon, and Evangelicals have long viewed Mormons as faux Christians and theological heretics who follow Joseph Smith rather than Jesus Christ. On closer examination, much of the bad blood between Evangelicals and Mormons might stem from how similar they are: both Mormonism and Evangelicalism are culturally conservative, politically active, proselytizing movements whose ethos was shaped in the wave of 19th-century American revivalism that historians call the Second Great Awakening.\n\nThis year Mitt Romney has been one of the clarion voices in the conservative movement who has consistently pointed out the danger of Trump. He has called out Trump’s foreign policy idiocy, his lies, his moral vacancy, and his existential threat to the American republic. Romney has demonstrated a level of courage and principle that so many Republican elected officials and partisans have lacked.\n\nBut while Romney’s principled stance has been lonely within the cowardly elite circles of the Republican Party, he has not been alone. His fellow Mormons have expressed in polls and in statements their revulsion for Trumpism. In a survey this past week among Utah Mormons only 38% said they were supporting Trump, with a higher percentage of them saying they have an unfavorable view of Trump than of the perennially unpopular Hillary Clinton. In our hyper-partisan times, a Republican candidate getting only 38% of the Utah Mormon vote is a veritable castigation. And if my Mormon friends are any sort of representative sample, the community’s distaste for Trump is deep-seated and rooted in righteousness.\n\nMormons, like Evangelicals, have a strong commitment to international missions, leading them to rebuff Trump’s “America first” nationalism that would alienate the rest of the globe. Mormons have also repudiated Trump’s scapegoating of Latino immigrants and refugees. As a religious minority who has faced more than their share of persecution in America, they are acutely aware of the peril of Trump’s anti-Muslim stances. In short, Mormons have chosen to look beyond the immediate political interests and historical alignments of their own community in this election and see Trump for the evil that he and his campaign are.\n\nMormons have gone so far as to put up as a presidential candidate one of their own, a heretofore unknown named Evan McMullin, as a faithful alternative to Trump. Just this past week, McMullin pulled into striking range of both Trump and Clinton in Utah polls, and while his potential for winning the White House is virtually nil, he has given Mormons someone for whom they can conscientiously vote without holding their noses. In just about every way imaginable the Mormon community has resisted Trump, Trumpism, and the odious sorts of political bargain-with-the-devil dealmaking to which a solid majority of white Evangelicals have succumbed.\n\nOf course, a number of Evangelical leaders and voices have spoken out against Trump. Russell Moore, Christianity Today, and a growing ensemble of non-white Evangelicals have told the truth about what Trump is and what he represents. But they are shouting into the wind of Evangelical support for Trump, including from many of the guiding lights of the Moral Majority like Jerry Falwell Jr., James Dobson, and Ralph Reed. A pretty good rule of thumb: when you find yourself marching in lock step with the likes of David Duke, the Alt Right, and other out and out racists, you have forsaken the right to tout your morality.\n\nIf the test of the moral courage of a religious movement is how they stand for their values when there is an opportunity to abandon them for political expediency, then Mormons have passed the test thus far in 2016. They have been the Moral Minority. They are the Daniels, the Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednegos, the Esthers of this election season, who have refused the idolatry and apostasy that Trump embodies in his gilded insanity. While Evangelicals may still quibble with Mormons about theology and scripture and history, they should take a lesson from Mormons’ righteous backbone while there is still time.",

Crawford, who in 1916 was said to be one of the wealthiest black men in Abbeville County, was proud and strong and hated racism and vowed that, &ldquo;The day a white man hits me is the day I die.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Crawford, born in 1865, was well-respected and was a very successful businessman. He is said to have owned 10 percent of all of the land owned by blacks in the county. He had relatively good relationships even with the white citizens of Abbeville, primarily due to his wealth.</p>\n<p>But he was still a black man in a world ruled and shaped by white supremacy. Even a wealthy black man jeopardized his life if he dared argue with a white man, but Crawford did just that. He was not about to be cheated out of the market price for his harvest of cottonseed. The argument between Crawford and the vendor intensified and moved into the town square, drawing the attention of local residents. Crawford was arrested and put into jail. He paid his bail and was on his way out of harm&rsquo;s way when the angry crowd of whites which had assembled as Crawford and the white vendor argued, spotted him. Crawford fought to defend himself, injuring one white mobster, and was put in jail, but the crowd stormed the jail, beat Crawford nearly to death, then dragged Crawford&rsquo;s unconscious body out to the town square. When Crawford regained consciousness, the crowd beat him again, tied him to the back of a buggy, dragged him to a location nearby where they hung him from a tree and loaded 200 rounds of ammunition into him.</p>\n<p>After Crawford&rsquo;s murder, his family was ordered to get out of town; it was no longer safe for them there, and so they indeed left &ndash; but this lynching caused the emigration of over half of the black population of Abbeville to leave as well, devastating the city and its economy. Crawford&rsquo;s family settled in parts of Illinois, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia. Lynching caused many African Americans who lived in the South to flee their homes. It is a reason behind the Great Migration that few Americans want to talk about. Johnson feels that the silence has been too loud, and too long.</p>\n<p>Johnson says that her great-great grandfather was the central figure in the 2005 United States Senate apology for lynching. Writes Johnson, &ldquo;The senators felt it appropriate to acknowledge their inability to pass federal anti-lynching legislation even after 200 attempts and across seven presidencies.&rdquo; Johnson sat on the steering committee that helped draft the legislation.</p>\n<p>The prominence of the landmark is significant, in that very few landmarks of African American history are visible in the South, even as Confederate flags and statues of revered Confederate military heroes are everywhere. It is not common, even, for African American schools to be named after segregationists. It is a reality that other organizations have sought to change, including the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), which is erecting a lynching museum in Montgomery, Alabama. Part of the memorializing of Crawford will include a ritual begun by EJI at lynching sites throughout the South: the digging up of dirt from the sites to be put in jars with the names of victims who died at specific sites. At the commemoration on Friday the Samuel DeWitt Proctor Conference, Inc., (SDPC)will lead what is being called a &ldquo;service of consecration&rdquo; as a part of its ongoing project of invoking &ldquo;sacred memory&rdquo; of the history of African Americans.</p>\n<p>In addition to SDPC, representatives from the We Say Enough Campaign and the Southern Truth and Reconciliation Network, partners in this effort, will be present. Students from Kenyon College in Ohio will participate; there will be a Septima Clark Freedom School ongoing throughout the day on Friday to provide a space in which tell the stories and the history of lynching in this country, followed by the service of consecration. On Saturday, the historic landmark will be unveiled, followed by a worship service later that evening at Cypress Chapel AME Church. Family members of Ida B. Wells Barnett, who led an anti-lynching crusade, will be in attendance , as well as members of the family of Emmett Till, a teenager visiting the South from Chicago, Illinois, who was lynched in Money, Mississippi joining the Crawford family as Crawford and others are remembered.</p>\n<p>Johnson says the event will be intentional about offering &ldquo;radical truth telling, outdoors, among the Confederate symbols and statues that deny and suffocate the lives of the many African enslaved people who lived and died in Abbeville. My family has a story to tell, an analysis that is profoundly impactful,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>No more suffocation of the truth, she and others say. Anthony Crawford&rsquo;s determination to fight white supremacy and all of its ugly tentacles, will surely be felt in his spirit, which in spite of the horror of his death, certainly never left Abbeville.</p>",

    "plain_text": "\nIn Abbeville, South Carolina next Saturday, a historical marker honoring the life of an African American man lynched 100 years ago for challenging a white man who was cheating him out of competitive prices for crops delivered will be unveiled…in the Abbeville town square.\n\nWhile some native whites in the area are not pleased, the event calling to memory this event is part of a larger effort underway to bring to light the phenomenon of lynching and its effect on African Americans and, ironically, white society as well, something that many believe can and should no longer be swept under the carpet.\n\nDoria Johnson, a Ph.D. candidate in history at the University of Wisconsin, is the great-great granddaughter of Anthony Crawford and has been pushing the story of Crawford as a part of her life’s work. Crawford, who in 1916 was said to be one of the wealthiest black men in Abbeville County, was proud and strong and hated racism and vowed that, “The day a white man hits me is the day I die.”\n\nCrawford, born in 1865, was well-respected and was a very successful businessman. He is said to have owned 10 percent of all of the land owned by blacks in the county. He had relatively good relationships even with the white citizens of Abbeville, primarily due to his wealth.\n\nBut he was still a black man in a world ruled and shaped by white supremacy. Even a wealthy black man jeopardized his life if he dared argue with a white man, but Crawford did just that. He was not about to be cheated out of the market price for his harvest of cottonseed. The argument between Crawford and the vendor intensified and moved into the town square, drawing the attention of local residents. Crawford was arrested and put into jail. He paid his bail and was on his way out of harm’s way when the angry crowd of whites which had assembled as Crawford and the white vendor argued, spotted him. Crawford fought to defend himself, injuring one white mobster, and was put in jail, but the crowd stormed the jail, beat Crawford nearly to death, then dragged Crawford’s unconscious body out to the town square. When Crawford regained consciousness, the crowd beat him again, tied him to the back of a buggy, dragged him to a location nearby where they hung him from a tree and loaded 200 rounds of ammunition into him.\n\nAfter Crawford’s murder, his family was ordered to get out of town; it was no longer safe for them there, and so they indeed left – but this lynching caused the emigration of over half of the black population of Abbeville to leave as well, devastating the city and its economy. Crawford’s family settled in parts of Illinois, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia. Lynching caused many African Americans who lived in the South to flee their homes. It is a reason behind the Great Migration that few Americans want to talk about. Johnson feels that the silence has been too loud, and too long.\n\nJohnson says that her great-great grandfather was the central figure in the 2005 United States Senate apology for lynching. Writes Johnson, “The senators felt it appropriate to acknowledge their inability to pass federal anti-lynching legislation even after 200 attempts and across seven presidencies.” Johnson sat on the steering committee that helped draft the legislation.\n\nThe prominence of the landmark is significant, in that very few landmarks of African American history are visible in the South, even as Confederate flags and statues of revered Confederate military heroes are everywhere. It is not common, even, for African American schools to be named after segregationists. It is a reality that other organizations have sought to change, including the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), which is erecting a lynching museum in Montgomery, Alabama. Part of the memorializing of Crawford will include a ritual begun by EJI at lynching sites throughout the South: the digging up of dirt from the sites to be put in jars with the names of victims who died at specific sites. At the commemoration on Friday the Samuel DeWitt Proctor Conference, Inc., (SDPC)will lead what is being called a “service of consecration” as a part of its ongoing project of invoking “sacred memory” of the history of African Americans.\n\nIn addition to SDPC, representatives from the We Say Enough Campaign and the Southern Truth and Reconciliation Network, partners in this effort, will be present. Students from Kenyon College in Ohio will participate; there will be a Septima Clark Freedom School ongoing throughout the day on Friday to provide a space in which tell the stories and the history of lynching in this country, followed by the service of consecration. On Saturday, the historic landmark will be unveiled, followed by a worship service later that evening at Cypress Chapel AME Church. Family members of Ida B. Wells Barnett, who led an anti-lynching crusade, will be in attendance , as well as members of the family of Emmett Till, a teenager visiting the South from Chicago, Illinois, who was lynched in Money, Mississippi joining the Crawford family as Crawford and others are remembered.\n\nJohnson says the event will be intentional about offering “radical truth telling, outdoors, among the Confederate symbols and statues that deny and suffocate the lives of the many African enslaved people who lived and died in Abbeville. My family has a story to tell, an analysis that is profoundly impactful,” she said.\n\nNo more suffocation of the truth, she and others say. Anthony Crawford’s determination to fight white supremacy and all of its ugly tentacles, will surely be felt in his spirit, which in spite of the horror of his death, certainly never left Abbeville.",

    "plain_text": "\nGOA, India (Reuters) - The development bank set up by the BRICS group of emerging economies will ramp up lending to $2.5 billion next year after making its first loans to back green projects, its president KV Kamath told Reuters.\n\nThe BRICS - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - agreed to create the New Development Bank (NDB) in July 2014 with initial authorized capital of $100 billion. The lender was officially launched a year later.\n\n“The second year is scaling up, concentrating on people, getting all the skillsets in,” said Kamath, a veteran Indian banker appointed as the first head of the Shanghai-based NDB.\n\nHe was speaking on the fringes of a weekend BRICS summit hosted in the Indian resort of Goa by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The gathering seeks to add substance to the group that grew out of an acronym devised by Goldman Sachs economist Jim O’Neill back in 2003 that projected a long-term boom and global power shift in their favor.\n\nWith Russia, Brazil and South Africa on the economic skids and China slowing, the initial euphoria has faded, yet Kamath said the BRICS had much to gain by deepening their cooperation.\n\n“The fact is that these countries, collectively, have for the last few years contributed to more than 50 percent of incremental economic wealth that has been generated globally,” said Kamath. “I don’t see that changing.”\n\nThe NDB, headquartered in Shanghai, will expand its staff to 300 over the next three years but run a tight operation that seeks to take quick decisions and transfer experience across all fiveBRICS member states.\n\nIt has already approved loans totaling $900 million to green projects in each member state. It has also started a renminbi-denominated borrowing program, issuing a 3 billion yuan ($450 million) bond.\n\nKamath, 68, said there was plenty of room for new lenders like the NDB and the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), in addition to established institutions like the World Bank.\n\n“Infrastructure alone has needs globally of $1-1.5 trillion a year – all the multilateral banks put together can do maybe 15 percent of this,” said Kamath, who ran India’s ICICI Bank Ltd <ICBK.NS> from 1996 until 2009.\n\n“The phrase I would like to use is cooperate and work together, rather than compete. I don’t see competition as a key challenge in this context.”",

There were more than 40 protesters involved an hour before the game began, Blue said, with the number expected to grow by kickoff.</p>\n<p>The groups, which gathered in a parking lot near the stadium before the game, carried signs that read &ldquo;Black Lives Matter&rdquo; and &ldquo;Protest is Patriotic,&rdquo; and others that bore the faces of famous athletes who have protested during sporting events.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"embed-asset embed\" data-type=\"embed-asset\" data-provider=\"Embed\" data-title=\"\">\n<div class=\"embed-code\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" align=\"center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We&#39;re here to kneel with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kaepernick7\">@Kaepernick7</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/billsfans4blacklives?src=hash\">#billsfans4blacklives</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdgeofSports\">@EdgeofSports</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gzornick\">@gzornick</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESPNNFL\">@ESPNNFL</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/fLryU98jO1\">pic.twitter.com/fLryU98jO1</a></p>&mdash; SURJ Buffalo (@SURJBuffalo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SURJBuffalo/status/787674400627757057\">October 16, 2016</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></div>\n     <p>The groups marched from the lot to the stadium, where they planned to kneel during the anthem as it played inside.

    "plain_text": "\nDozens of Buffalo Bills fans gathered outside Ralph Wilson Stadium in Buffalo, New York, on Sunday and knelt during the playing of the national anthem before the team’s game against the San Francisco 49ers, in a show of solidarity with 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.\n\nKaepernick, who will make his first start of the season in Buffalo, has knelt during the anthem before games since the preseason to protest police brutality and killings of African Americans.\n\n“We had been talking about doing this for a while even before we found out he was starting,” Caitlin Blue, a 21-year-old from Buffalo, told The Huffington Post, speaking by phone from outside the stadium. “We want to show that we support him because what he’s doing is very patriotic, and as Bills fans, we stand for racial justice.”\n\nThe protest was organized by Just Resisting, a group of organizers of people of color, and a local chapter of Showing Up For Racial Justice, which seeks to organize white people to stand up for racial equality. There were more than 40 protesters involved an hour before the game began, Blue said, with the number expected to grow by kickoff.\n\nThe groups, which gathered in a parking lot near the stadium before the game, carried signs that read “Black Lives Matter” and “Protest is Patriotic,” and others that bore the faces of famous athletes who have protested during sporting events. \n\nWe're here to kneel with @Kaepernick7 #billsfans4blacklives @EdgeofSports @gzornick @ESPNNFL pic.twitter.com/fLryU98jO1— SURJ Buffalo (@SURJBuffalo) October 16, 2016\n\n     \nThe groups marched from the lot to the stadium, where they planned to kneel during the anthem as it played inside. Buffalo News reporter Nick Veronica posted a video of the march on Twitter:\n\n#Bills fans leading march in support of Kaepernick. They plan to kneel while the anthem is played. #49ers pic.twitter.com/vGumORFit4— Nick Veronica (@NickVeronica) October 16, 2016\n\n     \nThe 49ers-Bills game took on political significance this week when San Francisco coach Chip Kelly announced that Kaepernick would start in place of the struggling Blaine Gabbert. Bills head coach Rex Ryan is a supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has spoken out against Kaepernick and the Black Lives Matter movement during the campaign. Ryan introduced Trump at a Buffalo campaign rally in April.\n\nSome Buffalo fans pushed back against Kaepernick’s protests before the game, with T-shirts and signs telling him to “shut up and stand up.” Some fans booed and chanted “U-S-A” before the game began, according to reports.\n\nShirts with a rifle scope trained on Colin Kaepernick selling for $10 outside of Ralph Wilson stadium. pic.twitter.com/bSuxF3G5qq— Robert Klemko (@RobertKlemko) October 16, 2016\n\n     \nBlue said the protests received a mixed response from fans before the game.\n\n“We expect there to be naysayers, we expect there to be people against us,” Blue said. “We’ve also seen lots of people that say they love what we’re doing.”\n\nThe protesters are also challenging Ryan’s support of Trump, who has faced a spate of sexual assault allegations in the last week.\n\n“Rex endorses him, and continues to do so, even after Trump has talked about sexually assaulting women. We want people to know that’s not what Buffalo stands for at all,” Blue said.\n\n“Some of the fans don’t really care, and that’s a problem,” she continued. “They should care about who’s representing them.”",

Trinity Gay était considérée comme l'un des grands espoirs de l'athlétisme américain, spécialiste, comme son père, du sprint.\n\n\nLa Fédération américaine d'athlétisme a présenté ses condoléances à Gay sur son compte Twitter: \"Nos pensées et prières vont vers Tyson Gay et ses proches après le décès tragique et incompréhensible de sa fille Trinity\", a écrit l'Ustaf.\n\n\n\n\nSending our thoughts & prayers to @TysonLGay & his loved ones as they mourn the tragic & senseless loss of his daughter, Trinity.\n— USATF (@usatf) 16 octobre 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Dimanche, vers 4 heures du matin, des policiers se sont rendus sur le parking du restaurant Cook Out où des coups de feu ont été tirés\", a indiqué la police de Lexington, dans le Kentucky. \"Des témoins ont indiqué que ces coups de feu ont été échangés entre deux véhicules, une Dodge Charger grise et une voiture de sport de couleur sombre aux vitres teintées\", poursuit le communiqué.\n\n\n\n\n\nTyson Gay est effondré\n\n\n\n\"Une adolescente touchée lors de cet échange de coups de feu a été transportée dans une voiture privée jusqu'à un hôpital, d'où elle a été ensuite transférée vers l'hôpital universitaire du Kentucky où elle est décédée. (...) La victime a été identifiée: il s'agit de Trinity Gay, 15 ans et habitante de Lexington\", a précisé la police.\n\n\n\nSur NBC, le deuxième homme le plus rapide de l'histoire sur 100 m s'est dit effondré: \"je suis tellement bouleversé. Elle était ici la semaine dernière pour les vacances. C'est fou. Je ne sais pas ce qui s'est passé.\"\n\n\n\nLire aussi :\n\n\n• Le discours émouvant de Barack Obama en hommage aux policiers tués\n\n\n• Un ancien Marine identifié comme le tueur des trois policiers à Bâton-Rouge\n\n\n• Pour suivre les dernières actualités en direct sur Le HuffPost, cliquez ici\n\n\n• Tous les matins, recevez gratuitement la newsletter du HuffPost\n\n\n• Retrouvez-nous sur notre page Facebook\n\n\n\nÀ voir également sur Le HuffPost:\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

The two had never met. Trump then <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html\" target=\"_blank\">physically assaulted her</a>:&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"98\" data-total-count=\"758\">About 45 minutes after takeoff, she recalled, Mr. Trump lifted the armrest and began to touch her.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"93\" data-total-count=\"851\">According to Ms. Leeds, Mr. Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt.</p>\n<p id=\"story-continues-3\" class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"72\" data-total-count=\"923\">&ldquo;He was like an octopus,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;His hands were everywhere.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"69\" data-total-count=\"992\">She fled to the back of the plane. &ldquo;It was an assault,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On CNN&rsquo;s &ldquo;State of the Union&rdquo; Sunday, Giuliani said that because he&rsquo;s rich and gets to fly first class all the time, he knows such an assault could never happen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Fifteen minutes of groping in a first-class cabin of an airplane, doesn&rsquo;t make sense,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in first class a lot, fortunately. Since I stopped being mayor, I can afford first class. You see everything that goes on in first class.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sexual assault on airplanes <a href=\"http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Surge-in-Sexual-Assaults-on-Airplanes-244798921.html\" target=\"_blank\">happens</a>, even if Giuliani doesn&rsquo;t think it does. In late August, Slate reported that the FBI had 40 open cases involving sexual assaults on aircraft in 2015 and <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2016/08/what_happens_when_sexual_assault_happens_on_a_long_haul_flight.html\" target=\"_blank\">37 cases so far in 2016</a>. No federal agency, however, maintains&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Surge-in-Sexual-Assaults-on-Airplanes-244798921.html\" target=\"_blank\">data</a> on sexual assaults on airplanes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But there are plenty of reports of these incidents. A man who tried to <a href=\"http://www.staradvertiser.com/2016/02/24/breaking-news/judge-rules-hilo-man-who-tried-to-rape-a-woman-in-airplane-bathroom-is-insane/\" target=\"_blank\">rape a woman in a plane bathroom</a>. A man who <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2016/08/what_happens_when_sexual_assault_happens_on_a_long_haul_flight.html\" target=\"_blank\">molested a woman</a>&nbsp;asleep in the seat next to him. Another man who tried to <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-arrested-jfk-accused-molesting-woman-slept-article-1.1914133\" target=\"_blank\">put his hands down the pants</a> of a sleeping woman.</p>\n<p>Even when women do report these incidents, flight crews don&rsquo;t always know what to do. When a woman named Dana T. reported her sexual assault to a flight attendant, she first faced skepticism. The man eventually admitted to what he did ― <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2016/08/what_happens_when_sexual_assault_happens_on_a_long_haul_flight.html\" target=\"_blank\">claiming it was an &ldquo;accident&rdquo;</a> ― but was allowed to leave the plane without any repercussions or questioning by law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson also tried to use the &ldquo;it couldn&rsquo;t happen in first class&rdquo; defense recently, claiming that first-class sections of planes didn&rsquo;t have movable armrests back then. (<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-armrest-truther_us_57ff1a78e4b0162c0439fcb6\">They did</a>.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Trump has responded to the women who have accused him of sexual assault by <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-sexual-assault_us_57ffc493e4b0162c043aa2a3\">attacking their physical appearance</a> and saying they were too ugly to have attracted his attention anyway.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>HUFFPOST READERS:&nbsp;</strong>What&rsquo;s happening in your state or district?

    "plain_text": "\n\n     \nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) vigorously defended his man for president, Donald Trump, on Sunday against the many women who have stepped forward and accused him of sexually assaulting them.\n\n“Some of these things appear to me, on their face, to be kind of untrue,” Giuliani said, adding that he didn’t want to accuse the women of “lying” but that he believes Trump, who has said they are lying.\n\nJessica Leeds, 74, told The New York Times recently that more than three decades ago, she sat next to Trump in the first-class section of a flight to New York. The two had never met. Trump then physically assaulted her: \n\n\nAbout 45 minutes after takeoff, she recalled, Mr. Trump lifted the armrest and began to touch her.\n\nAccording to Ms. Leeds, Mr. Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt.\n\n“He was like an octopus,” she said. “His hands were everywhere.”\n\nShe fled to the back of the plane. “It was an assault,” she said.\n\n\nOn CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday, Giuliani said that because he’s rich and gets to fly first class all the time, he knows such an assault could never happen. \n\n“Fifteen minutes of groping in a first-class cabin of an airplane, doesn’t make sense,” he said. “I’ve been in first class a lot, fortunately. Since I stopped being mayor, I can afford first class. You see everything that goes on in first class.”\n\nSexual assault on airplanes happens, even if Giuliani doesn’t think it does. In late August, Slate reported that the FBI had 40 open cases involving sexual assaults on aircraft in 2015 and 37 cases so far in 2016. No federal agency, however, maintains data on sexual assaults on airplanes. \n\nBut there are plenty of reports of these incidents. A man who tried to rape a woman in a plane bathroom. A man who molested a woman asleep in the seat next to him. Another man who tried to put his hands down the pants of a sleeping woman.\n\nEven when women do report these incidents, flight crews don’t always know what to do. When a woman named Dana T. reported her sexual assault to a flight attendant, she first faced skepticism. The man eventually admitted to what he did ― claiming it was an “accident” ― but was allowed to leave the plane without any repercussions or questioning by law enforcement.\n\nTrump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson also tried to use the “it couldn’t happen in first class” defense recently, claiming that first-class sections of planes didn’t have movable armrests back then. (They did.) \n\nTrump has responded to the women who have accused him of sexual assault by attacking their physical appearance and saying they were too ugly to have attracted his attention anyway.\n\n \n\nHUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Only 23 percent say Trump probably hasn&rsquo;t made unwanted advances on women, and 29 percent don&rsquo;t have an opinion. Among independents, 71 percent think he has made such advances and 13 percent disagree.

Presumably for Democrats that&rsquo;s because they were already not voting for him, and for Republicans because they don&rsquo;t want to see a Democrat win the presidency.</span></p><div class=\"embed-asset embed\" data-type=\"embed-asset\" data-provider=\"Embed\" data-title=\"\">\n<div class=\"embed-code\"><div style=\"max-width: 2968px;\"><div style=\"left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 70.3504%;\"><iframe src=\"//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/vozs9D\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\"></iframe></div></div></div></div>\n     <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump has attempted to deflect the controversy by reminding Americans of Bill Clinton&rsquo;s checkered past with women and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s words related to those cases. But only 30 percent of voters think it&rsquo;s a legitimate issue for this campaign. And just 13 percent say it&rsquo;s a very or extremely important issue. Fifty-five percent say Trump&rsquo;s treatment of women is a legitimate issue, including 36 percent who say it&rsquo;s very or extremely important.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voters in battleground states mirror these nationwide numbers.

Fifty-seven percent say Trump&rsquo;s comments on the tape were offensive, including 60 percent of independents and 70 percent of women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nearly half of battleground state voters ― including 40 percent of Republicans ― said the comments were offensive but didn&rsquo;t change their vote intention. Only 5 percent of Republicans and 12 percent of independents said they couldn&rsquo;t support Trump after hearing the tape. That indicates the effect of the tape could be limited.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the effects of the sexual assault allegations that emerged late in the week aren&rsquo;t included in these polls, which were conducted Oct. 10-13 (ABC/Washington Post) and Oct. 12-14 (CBS).

    "plain_text": "\nDespite Donald Trump’s repeated denials of nefarious behavior toward women and his media-blaming tactics, a new ABC/Washington Post poll shows that nearly 7 in 10 voters think Trump probably did make unwanted advances on women. \n\nNearly half ― 48 percent ― of Republicans agree. Only 23 percent say Trump probably hasn’t made unwanted advances on women, and 29 percent don’t have an opinion. Among independents, 71 percent think he has made such advances and 13 percent disagree. Not surprisingly, 87 percent of Democrats believe Trump probably followed through on his words captured in the 2005 discussion caught on tape with Billy Bush.\n\nA majority of registered voters think that conversation goes beyond “locker room talk.” Fifty-two percent say the comments go farther than how most men talk about women, and 57 percent doubt the sincerity of Trump’s apology. \n\nAt the same time, most say the tape itself doesn’t make them less likely to vote for Trump. Presumably for Democrats that’s because they were already not voting for him, and for Republicans because they don’t want to see a Democrat win the presidency.\n\n     \nTrump has attempted to deflect the controversy by reminding Americans of Bill Clinton’s checkered past with women and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s words related to those cases. But only 30 percent of voters think it’s a legitimate issue for this campaign. And just 13 percent say it’s a very or extremely important issue. Fifty-five percent say Trump’s treatment of women is a legitimate issue, including 36 percent who say it’s very or extremely important.\n\nVoters in battleground states mirror these nationwide numbers. A CBS Battleground Tracker, which polls voters across 13 critical states, asked similar questions. \n\nSeventy percent of voters in these states say Donald Trump doesn’t respect women ― including 66 percent of men. Fifty-seven percent say Trump’s comments on the tape were offensive, including 60 percent of independents and 70 percent of women. \n\nNearly half of battleground state voters ― including 40 percent of Republicans ― said the comments were offensive but didn’t change their vote intention. Only 5 percent of Republicans and 12 percent of independents said they couldn’t support Trump after hearing the tape. That indicates the effect of the tape could be limited.\n\nBut the effects of the sexual assault allegations that emerged late in the week aren’t included in these polls, which were conducted Oct. 10-13 (ABC/Washington Post) and Oct. 12-14 (CBS). And even small changes in voters’ willingness to vote for Trump could destroy his chances of winning the presidency, which were already very low. \n\nTrump, of course, blames the media and falsely claims the polls are “close.” They’re not. \n\nPolls close, but can you believe I lost large numbers of women voters based on made up events THAT NEVER HAPPENED. Media rigging election!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016\n\n     \nEditor’s note: Donald Trump regularly\nincites\npolitical violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe,\nracist, misogynist and birther who has\nrepeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from\nentering the U.S.",

L'atterrisseur europ&eacute;en Schiaparelli a entam&eacute; dimanche 16 octobre une descente d'un million de kilom&egrave;tres vers Mars o&ugrave; il doit se poser trois jours plus tard: un d&eacute;fi technologique pour l'Europe qui veut prouver qu'elle ma&icirc;trise cet exercice difficile. Jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent, seuls les Am&eacute;ricains ont r&eacute;ussi &agrave; poser <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/08/28/le-francais-cyprien-verseux-revient-enfin-de-mars-retour-sur/\" target=\"_blank\">sur Mars</a> des engins qui sont parvenus &agrave; fonctionner.</^p>\n\n<p>\n<p>Apr&egrave;s un p&eacute;riple de sept mois pour rejoindre <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/10/13/des-scientifiques-veulent-creer-asgardia-le-premier-pays-dans-l/\" target=\"_blank\">la plan&egrave;te rouge</a>, Schiaparelli s'est s&eacute;par&eacute; vers 16 heures 40 heure fran&ccedil;aise de la sonde europ&eacute;ano-russe TGO. La s&eacute;paration a &eacute;t&eacute; \"confirm&eacute;e\", a d&eacute;clar&eacute; sous les applaudissements Michel Denis, directeur des op&eacute;rations en vol <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/news/exomars/\" target=\"_blank\">d'ExoMars</a> 2016, depuis le centre de contr&ocirc;le de l'ESA &agrave; Darmstadt en Allemagne. La sonde TGO doit d&eacute;sormais s'&eacute;carter avant de s'ins&eacute;rer en orbite autour de la plan&egrave;te rouge, une phase d&eacute;licate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>C'est la deuxi&egrave;me fois que l'Europe cherche &agrave; atterrir sur Mars</strong></p>\n\n<p>Il y a treize ans, la sonde europ&eacute;enne Mars Express avait largu&eacute; <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle_2\" target=\"_blank\">un mini-atterrisseur Beagle 2</a> qui n'a jamais donn&eacute; signe de vie. Ce n'est qu'en 2015 que les images d'une sonde am&eacute;ricaine ont permis de constater qu'il avait effectivement atterri mais que ses panneaux solaires n'&eacute;taient pas tous d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s.</p>\n\n<p>Le grand saut de Schiaparelli est la premi&egrave;re &eacute;tape <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/news/exomars/\" target=\"_blank\">d'ExoMars</a>, une ambitieuse mission scientifique europ&eacute;ano-russe en deux volets, qui vise &agrave; rechercher des indices d'une vie actuelle et pass&eacute;e sur Mars.</p>\n\n<p>La sonde TGO sera charg&eacute;e de \"renifler\" l'atmosph&egrave;re martienne pour d&eacute;tecter des gaz &agrave; l'&eacute;tat de traces comme le m&eacute;thane qui pourrait indiquer la pr&eacute;sence d'une forme de vie actuelle sur la plan&egrave;te. Elle se mettra au travail d&eacute;but 2018.</p>\n\n<p>En 2020, l'Europe et la Russie enverront sur Mars un gros rover qui b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiera des d&eacute;veloppements technologiques de Schiaparelli. Il effectuera des forages pour tenter de retrouver des traces d'une vie bact&eacute;rienne pass&eacute;e.</p>\n\n<p>L'atterrissage sur Mars n'est pas chose ais&eacute;e et la descente de Schiaparelli pourrait &ecirc;tre compliqu&eacute;e par la m&eacute;t&eacute;o si survenait une temp&ecirc;te martienne. \"Nous savions que nous allions arriver pendant la saison des temp&ecirc;tes de poussi&egrave;res et cela nous a amen&eacute;s &agrave; faire un design plus robuste pour Schiaparelli\", rel&egrave;ve Thierry Blancquaert, responsable de l'atterrisseur &agrave; l'ESA, l'agence spatiale europ&eacute;enne.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Une vie de courte dur&eacute;e</strong></p>\n\n<p>TGO et Schiaparelli, nomm&eacute; en honneur de l'astronome italien du XIXe si&egrave;cle, ont parcouru pr&egrave;s de 500 millions de kilom&egrave;tres depuis leur lancement en mars par une fus&eacute;e russe Proton depuis Ba&iuml;konour au Kazakhstan.</p>\n\n<p>Schiaparelli, qui a une masse de 577 kilos au d&eacute;part, est une capsule de 2m40 de diam&egrave;tre qui ressemble un peu &agrave; \"une piscine gonflable pour b&eacute;b&eacute;\", selon Michel Denis. \"La partie inf&eacute;rieure du module est prot&eacute;g&eacute;e par une structure &eacute;crasable en aluminium, en nid d'abeilles, destin&eacute;e &agrave; amortir le choc final\", souligne Thierry Blancquaert.</p>\n\n<p>La descente durera trois jours. Mais seulement six minutes entre le moment o&ugrave; Schiaparelli entrera dans l'atmosph&egrave;re martienne et son impact au sol. Un bouclier thermique le prot&eacute;gera de l'important &eacute;chauffement n&eacute; du contact avec l'atmosph&egrave;re et le ralentira. A 11 km de la surface, la vitesse du module sera descendue &agrave; 1.650 km/heure. Un parachute s'ouvrira alors pour le ralentir davantage.</p>\n\n<p>La vie de Schiaparelli sera de courte dur&eacute;e: deux &agrave; huit jours environ car il est seulement &eacute;quip&eacute; d'une batterie non rechargeable.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lire aussi :</strong></p>\n\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/10/11/les-nombreux-obstacles-avant-denvoyer-un-homme-sur-mars-et-les/?utm_hp_ref=fr-espace\">Les nombreux obstacles avant d'envoyer un homme sur Mars</a></p>\n\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/10/06/proxima-b-pourrait-etre-un-immense-ocean/?utm_hp_ref=fr-espace\">L'exoplan&egrave;te la plus proche de la Terre pourrait &ecirc;tre un immense oc&eacute;an</a></p>\n\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/10/04/les-reves-fous-dhotels-sexy-en-orbite-de-richard-branson/?utm_hp_ref=fr-espace\">Les r&ecirc;ves fous d'h&ocirc;tels sexy en orbite de Richard Branson</a></p>\n\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/cest-demain/\" target=\"_blank\">Pour suivre les derni&egrave;res actualit&eacute;s de C'est Demain, cliquez ici</a></p>\n\n<p>&bull;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/newsletter/france\" target=\"_hplink\"> Tous les matins, recevez gratuitement la newsletter du <em>HuffPost</em></a></p>\n\n<p>&bull;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HuffPostCestDemain\" target=\"_hplink\"> Retrouvez-nous sur notre page Facebook</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>&Agrave; voir &eacute;galement sur <em>Le HuffPost</em>:</strong></p>\n\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"355\" hspace=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.ultimedia.com/deliver/generic/iframe/mdtk/01590560/zone/1/showtitle/1/src/uvf0kk\" style=\"z-index:1;\" vspace=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"630\"></iframe><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"355\" hspace=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.ultimedia.com/deliver/generic/iframe/mdtk/01590560/zone/1/showtitle/1/src/ukrup0\" style=\"z-index:1;\" vspace=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"630\"></iframe></p>\n</div>",

    "plain_text": "ESPACE - Une descente dans les étoiles. L'atterrisseur européen Schiaparelli a entamé dimanche 16 octobre une descente d'un million de kilomètres vers Mars où il doit se poser trois jours plus tard: un défi technologique pour l'Europe qui veut prouver qu'elle maîtrise cet exercice difficile. Jusqu'à présent, seuls les Américains ont réussi à poser sur Mars des engins qui sont parvenus à fonctionner.\n\n\n\nAprès un périple de sept mois pour rejoindre la planète rouge, Schiaparelli s'est séparé vers 16 heures 40 heure française de la sonde européano-russe TGO. La séparation a été \"confirmée\", a déclaré sous les applaudissements Michel Denis, directeur des opérations en vol d'ExoMars 2016, depuis le centre de contrôle de l'ESA à Darmstadt en Allemagne. La sonde TGO doit désormais s'écarter avant de s'insérer en orbite autour de la planète rouge, une phase délicate.\n\n\nC'est la deuxième fois que l'Europe cherche à atterrir sur Mars\n\n\nIl y a treize ans, la sonde européenne Mars Express avait largué un mini-atterrisseur Beagle 2 qui n'a jamais donné signe de vie. Ce n'est qu'en 2015 que les images d'une sonde américaine ont permis de constater qu'il avait effectivement atterri mais que ses panneaux solaires n'étaient pas tous déployés.\n\n\nLe grand saut de Schiaparelli est la première étape d'ExoMars, une ambitieuse mission scientifique européano-russe en deux volets, qui vise à rechercher des indices d'une vie actuelle et passée sur Mars.\n\n\nLa sonde TGO sera chargée de \"renifler\" l'atmosphère martienne pour détecter des gaz à l'état de traces comme le méthane qui pourrait indiquer la présence d'une forme de vie actuelle sur la planète. Elle se mettra au travail début 2018. \n\n\nEn 2020, l'Europe et la Russie enverront sur Mars un gros rover qui bénéficiera des développements technologiques de Schiaparelli. Il effectuera des forages pour tenter de retrouver des traces d'une vie bactérienne passée. \n\n\nL'atterrissage sur Mars n'est pas chose aisée et la descente de Schiaparelli pourrait être compliquée par la météo si survenait une tempête martienne. \"Nous savions que nous allions arriver pendant la saison des tempêtes de poussières et cela nous a amenés à faire un design plus robuste pour Schiaparelli\", relève Thierry Blancquaert, responsable de l'atterrisseur à l'ESA, l'agence spatiale européenne.\n\n\n\nUne vie de courte durée\n\n\nTGO et Schiaparelli, nommé en honneur de l'astronome italien du XIXe siècle, ont parcouru près de 500 millions de kilomètres depuis leur lancement en mars par une fusée russe Proton depuis Baïkonour au Kazakhstan.\n\n\nSchiaparelli, qui a une masse de 577 kilos au départ, est une capsule de 2m40 de diamètre qui ressemble un peu à \"une piscine gonflable pour bébé\", selon Michel Denis. \"La partie inférieure du module est protégée par une structure écrasable en aluminium, en nid d'abeilles, destinée à amortir le choc final\", souligne Thierry Blancquaert.\n\n\nLa descente durera trois jours. Mais seulement six minutes entre le moment où Schiaparelli entrera dans l'atmosphère martienne et son impact au sol. Un bouclier thermique le protégera de l'important échauffement né du contact avec l'atmosphère et le ralentira. A 11 km de la surface, la vitesse du module sera descendue à 1.650 km/heure. Un parachute s'ouvrira alors pour le ralentir davantage. \n\n\nLa vie de Schiaparelli sera de courte durée: deux à huit jours environ car il est seulement équipé d'une batterie non rechargeable.\n\n\n\nLire aussi :\n\n\n• Les nombreux obstacles avant d'envoyer un homme sur Mars\n\n\n• L'exoplanète la plus proche de la Terre pourrait être un immense océan\n\n\n• Les rêves fous d'hôtels sexy en orbite de Richard Branson\n\n\n• Pour suivre les dernières actualités de C'est Demain, cliquez ici\n\n\n• Tous les matins, recevez gratuitement la newsletter du HuffPost\n\n\n• Retrouvez-nous sur notre page Facebook\n\n\n\nÀ voir également sur Le HuffPost:\n\n\n\n",

But even as she prepared to formally announce her presidential bid, she resisted entreaties from several staffers to have her husband, former President Bill Clinton, cancel one last speech to Morgan Stanley.</span></p>\n<p>The Clinton campaign did not directly respond to a request for comment on the internal communications, but pointed to a conference call in which campaign advisors said that the WikiLeaks emails had been hacked by the Russian government, which is believed to be trying to tilt the U.S. election in favor of GOP nominee <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>. The FBI has supported the Clinton campaign&rsquo;s assertions about Russian involvement in the email hack.</p>\n<p>The internal emails reveal Clinton staffers&rsquo; attempts to reason with a wealthy political candidate who didn&rsquo;t appreciate the potential damage that could be done if her husband ― referred to as &ldquo;WJC&rdquo; in the communications ― spoke to a prominent Wall Street firm just three days after she formally announced her presidential campaign.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staffers knew that Clinton didn&rsquo;t want to hear it, and maneuvered to make their objections understood.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;HRC very strongly did not want him to cancel that particular speech,&rdquo; wrote Clinton aide Huma Abedin on March 11, 2015. &ldquo;I think if John [Podesta] is getting involved in this scheduling matter, he must feel strongly. I will have to tell her that WJC chose to cancel it, not that we asked.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;Yes the issue is that if we&rsquo;re announcing on the 12th/13th and he&rsquo;s speaking to a wall street bank on the 15th, that&rsquo;s begging for a bad rollout,&rdquo; campaign manager Robby Mook replied. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Six and a half hours later, Abedin delivered the bad news to Mook and Podesta, a longtime Clinton confidante: &ldquo;John and Robby &ndash; HRC is reiterating her original position. She does not want him to cancel.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two hours after Abedin delivered the news about her boss&rsquo; resistance, Mook put his foot down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;I know this is not the answer she wants, but I feel very strongly that doing the speech is a mistake ― the data are very clear on the potential consequences. It will be three days after she&rsquo;s announced and on her first day in Iowa, where caucus [goers] have a sharply more negative view of Wall Street than the rest of the electorate. Wall Street ranks first for Iowans among a list of institutions that &ldquo;take advantage of every day Americans&rdquo;, scoring twice as high as the general election electorate. I recognize the sacrifice and [disappointment] that cancelling will create, but it&rsquo;s a very consequential unforced error and could plague us in stories for months.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;People would (rightfully) ask how we let it happen,&rdquo; Mook continued. &ldquo;I would suggest that if she is determined to keep this speech that she talk with John [because] this is a very big deal in my view.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the following afternoon, Clinton was willing to listen to reason.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;Robby &ndash; Just raised with her again,&rdquo; Abedin wrote. &ldquo;We are good to cancel esp if WJC is ok with it. Just needed a cool down period.&rdquo; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stories from Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/09/the-front-runner-s-fall/306944/\" target=\"_blank\">2008 campaign</a> are filled with accounts of backbiting nastiness between power-hungry staffers. But this episode portrays a staff unified in political acumen against a stubborn candidate. When the primary season began in earnest, Clinton&rsquo;s paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and other major Wall Street firms became a central point of controversy. Had Clinton not drawn a racist, xenophobic general election challenger who has boasted about committing sexual assault, these talks likely would have remained an issue into November.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Clintons made </span><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/12/pf/taxes/hillary-clinton-tax-return/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a combined $6.7 million</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in speaking fees in 2015.

    "plain_text": "\nHillary Clinton’s campaign staffers knew that her paid speeches to Wall Street could be a political liability for her 2016 run, according to private emails disclosed by WikiLeaks. But even as she prepared to formally announce her presidential bid, she resisted entreaties from several staffers to have her husband, former President Bill Clinton, cancel one last speech to Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe Clinton campaign did not directly respond to a request for comment on the internal communications, but pointed to a conference call in which campaign advisors said that the WikiLeaks emails had been hacked by the Russian government, which is believed to be trying to tilt the U.S. election in favor of GOP nominee Donald Trump. The FBI has supported the Clinton campaign’s assertions about Russian involvement in the email hack.\n\nThe internal emails reveal Clinton staffers’ attempts to reason with a wealthy political candidate who didn’t appreciate the potential damage that could be done if her husband ― referred to as “WJC” in the communications ― spoke to a prominent Wall Street firm just three days after she formally announced her presidential campaign.\n\nStaffers knew that Clinton didn’t want to hear it, and maneuvered to make their objections understood.\n\n“HRC very strongly did not want him to cancel that particular speech,” wrote Clinton aide Huma Abedin on March 11, 2015. “I think if John [Podesta] is getting involved in this scheduling matter, he must feel strongly. I will have to tell her that WJC chose to cancel it, not that we asked.”\n\n“Yes the issue is that if we’re announcing on the 12th/13th and he’s speaking to a wall street bank on the 15th, that’s begging for a bad rollout,” campaign manager Robby Mook replied. \n\nSix and a half hours later, Abedin delivered the bad news to Mook and Podesta, a longtime Clinton confidante: “John and Robby – HRC is reiterating her original position. She does not want him to cancel.”\n\nTwo hours after Abedin delivered the news about her boss’ resistance, Mook put his foot down.\n\n“I know this is not the answer she wants, but I feel very strongly that doing the speech is a mistake ― the data are very clear on the potential consequences. It will be three days after she’s announced and on her first day in Iowa, where caucus [goers] have a sharply more negative view of Wall Street than the rest of the electorate. Wall Street ranks first for Iowans among a list of institutions that “take advantage of every day Americans”, scoring twice as high as the general election electorate. I recognize the sacrifice and [disappointment] that cancelling will create, but it’s a very consequential unforced error and could plague us in stories for months.”\n\n“People would (rightfully) ask how we let it happen,” Mook continued. “I would suggest that if she is determined to keep this speech that she talk with John [because] this is a very big deal in my view.”\n\nBy the following afternoon, Clinton was willing to listen to reason.\n\n“Robby – Just raised with her again,” Abedin wrote. “We are good to cancel esp if WJC is ok with it. Just needed a cool down period.” \n\nStories from Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign are filled with accounts of backbiting nastiness between power-hungry staffers. But this episode portrays a staff unified in political acumen against a stubborn candidate. When the primary season began in earnest, Clinton’s paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and other major Wall Street firms became a central point of controversy. Had Clinton not drawn a racist, xenophobic general election challenger who has boasted about committing sexual assault, these talks likely would have remained an issue into November.\n\nThe Clintons made a combined $6.7 million in speaking fees in 2015. They brought in about $20 million in speaking fees the year before. It’s hard to blame Clinton’s staffers for wondering why they needed one more talk.\n\n\n\n     ",

Of course, she continued to perform as if nothing had happened.\n\nBey noticed her bleeding earlobe while she was singing her song “Haunted.”\n\nBeyoncé x #TidalX1015 Even with an ear bleeding. Queen   pic.twitter.com/yETFkldLFY— BADGALDODO (@DorianeADV) October 16, 2016\n\n     \nIn response, a few members of the Beyhive reportedly started cutting their ears in solidarity with Bey, sharing photos and messages with the hashtags #CutForBeyonce and #BleedForBeyonce on social media.\n\nSome of the images on social media are pretty graphic ― don’t say we didn’t warn you ― though it’s tough to say whether or not they’re real. (We hope they aren’t.) Some people sharing the hashtags may also just be trolls with too much time on their hands. Either way, the whole message is concerning, and if anyone is planning on cutting their ear for Beyoncé, please don’t.\n\nJust say the word @Beyonce #CutForBeyonce pic.twitter.com/earI9t9De5— ***Mikey (@B_NERD) October 16, 2016\n\n     \n\nI #CutForBeyonce—    (@Ahsam__) October 16, 2016\n\n     \n\nIf Beyoncé bleeds we bleed #cutforbeyonce— anais (@giselleknowlesc) October 16, 2016\n\n     \n\nIf Queen B had to endure pain, so do I.

This #CutForBeyonce gotta stop now.— Dominic Middleton (@DominicJermealM) October 16, 2016\n\n     \n\nOkay this #CutForBeyonce is not funny \".\" People out here cutting for serious shit and y'all making jokes— Kyree Harris (@KyreeMusic) October 16, 2016\n\n     \nAs Yahoo pointed out, the #CutForBeyonce and #BleedForBeyonce hashtags have existed for a few years, with the former first appearing in 2014 and the latter in 2013, after Bey didn’t win an award she was nominated for. \n\nA similar hashtag ― #CuttingForBieber ― popped up online in 2013 when Beliebers apparently started cutting themselves to encourage Justin Bieber to stop smoking weed. The whole thing turned out to be a disturbing hoax that stemmed from an even more disturbing 4chan joke set up to trick young fans into harming themselves.\n\nThis needs to stop. As Beyoncé herself said, “don’t hurt yourself.” ",

Quatre ans et demi apr&egrave;s le d&eacute;but de son combat contre le mariage pour les couples homosexuels et <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2014/10/05/la-manif-pour-tous-se-felicite-dune-maree-bleu-blanc-rose/?utm_hp_ref=fr-manif-pour-tous\" target=\"_blank\">deux ans apr&egrave;s sa derni&egrave;re manifestation</a>, La Manif pour tous (LMPT) a rassembl&eacute; plusieurs milliers de personnes &agrave; Paris pour raviver la flamme en esp&eacute;rant peser sur les candidats &agrave; la primaire de la droite et la pr&eacute;sidentielle.</p>\n\n<p>Le d&eacute;fil&eacute; a rassembl&eacute; entre 23.000 et 24.000 personnes, selon la pr&eacute;fecture de police de Paris. Les organisateurs avancent le chiffre de 200.000. Un &eacute;cart in&eacute;dit pour des chiffres au final assez &eacute;loign&eacute;s de la pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente mobilisation. Alors que les dirigeants de LMPT esp&eacute;raient mobiliser \"plus que jamais\" afin de peser sur l'ann&eacute;e &eacute;lectorale &agrave; venir, la participation de ce dimanche <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2014/10/06/manif-pour-tous-combien-de-participants_4501084_4355770.html\" target=\"_blank\">est la plus faible jamais enregistr&eacute;e</a>.</p>\n\n<p>En octobre 2014, La Manif pour tous, dont l'&eacute;toile faiblissait d&eacute;j&agrave;, avait r&eacute;uni 70.000 personnes selon la police, un demi-million selon le mouvement. Pour trouver une mobilisation aussi faible, il faut remonter au tout d&eacute;but du mouvement, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2012/11/16/typologie-des-opposants-au-mariage-gay-qui-defileront-ce-week-end_n_2144455.html\" target=\"_blank\">en novembre 2012</a>. Une manifestation parisienne avait alors vu d&eacute;filer 200.000 personnes selon les organisateurs. La police en avait compt&eacute; 70.000, soit trois plus que ce 16 octobre.</p>\n\n<p>Ce nouveau recul de participation n'a pas emp&ecirc;ch&eacute; le mouvement anti-mariage gay d'estimer son \"pari gagn&eacute;\". \"Nous sommes la premi&egrave;re force militante de France. Aucun parti ni candidat ne r&eacute;ussit &agrave; mobiliser autant\", s'est emball&eacute;e sa pr&eacute;sidente Ludovine de La Roch&egrave;re dans un communiqu&eacute;, en prenant soin d'&eacute;viter les comparaisons avec les mobilisations monstres contre la loi Travail. La Manif pour tous a par ailleurs toujours refus&eacute; de se d&eacute;finir comme un parti politique <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/10/16/pourquoi-la-manif-pour-tous-nest-jamais-devenue-un-parti-politique/?utm_hp_ref=fr-manif-pour-tous\" target=\"_blank\">(voici pourquoi)</a>.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>\"La famille, patrimoine de l'humanit&eacute;\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>\"J'esp&egrave;re que cette manifestation aura un poids sur la pr&eacute;sidentielle\", a toutefois d&eacute;clar&eacute; Guy, 29 ans, biblioth&eacute;caire.

From <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2012/patriot-movement-explodes\" target=\"_blank\">a 2012 report by SPLC</a>:&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the movement came roaring back beginning in late 2008, just as the economy went south with the subprime collapse and, more importantly, as Barack Obama appeared on the political scene as the Democratic nominee and, ultimately, the president-elect. Even as most of the nation cheered the election of the first black president that November, an angry backlash developed that included several plots to murder Obama. Many Americans, infused with populist fury over bank and auto bailouts and a feeling that they had lost their country, joined Patriot groups.</p>\n<p>The swelling of the Patriot movement since that time has been astounding. From 149 groups in 2008, the number of Patriot organizations skyrocketed to 512 in 2009, shot up again in 2010 to 824, and then,<a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2012/spring/active-patriot-groups-in-the-united-states\"> last year, jumped to 1,274</a>. That works out to a staggering 755% growth in the three years ending last Dec. 31. Last year&rsquo;s total was more than 400 groups higher than the prior all-time high, in 1996.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"m_1173071442044149635gmail-m-8381077376333574955gmail-m-1500926534469472605m-7681612964816160159msonormal\">Many African-Americans have also been frustrated with <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-fraud_us_57dc306de4b08cb14095aa80\">a long-running attempt</a> to delegitimize the first black president by claiming he wasn&rsquo;t born in the United States and therefore isn&rsquo;t really eligible to be president. They argue that these sorts of arguments wouldn&rsquo;t be used ― and haven&rsquo;t been used ― against a white president.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"m_1173071442044149635gmail-m-8381077376333574955gmail-m-1500926534469472605m-7681612964816160159msonormal\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dog whistle to all Americans, especially African-Americans,&rdquo; Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) said last month. &ldquo;If indeed Barack Obama is not intelligent, if indeed Barack Obama is not legitimate, then you striving up the corporate ladder, or striving to achieve something ... how can you feel good about yourself as a sixth-grader if you&rsquo;re an African-American?&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\"m_1173071442044149635gmail-m-8381077376333574955gmail-m-1500926534469472605m-7681612964816160159msonormal\">Already, this campaign season has seen sexism like no other in recent memory. Donald Trump has accused Clinton of playing the &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-woman-card-donors_us_5727b4c5e4b0b49df6ac0b3e\">woman card</a>&rdquo; and said she doesn&rsquo;t look &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-look-presidential_us_57a0d41ee4b08a8e8b5fa64f\">presidential</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"m_1173071442044149635gmail-m-8381077376333574955gmail-m-1500926534469472605m-7681612964816160159msonormal\">More recently, the discussion of the race has been focused around whether the nation will elect a man who has bragged about sexually assaulting women ― and has been <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-running-list-of-all-the-women-whove-accused-donald-trump-of-sexual-assault_us_57ffae1fe4b0162c043a7212\">accused of doing so</a> by numerous women. Trump has responded by insulting the looks of his accusers, saying they are too ugly to have attracted his notice in the first place.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>HUFFPOST READERS:&nbsp;</strong>What&rsquo;s happening in your state or district?

    "plain_text": "\n\n     \nVice President Joe Biden predicted that there will be an increase in sexism if Hillary Clinton becomes president, adding that he hopes it won’t be as bad as the uptick in racism that accompanied Barack Obama’s election.\n\n“We’ve moved, thank God, too far along in terms of, there’s not a single man I know, no matter...how much of a sexist he is, doesn’t know, there’re a whole lot of really smart competent women ― and smarter than he is,” Biden said in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday. “They may resent it, but they know it. ... I think it will surface.”\n\nBiden said he and the president always thought more racism would surface after Obama’s historic election in 2008 ― before clarifying that he could speak only for himself. \n\n“The president and I didn’t think it wouldn’t surface. ... He thought it would, too. I’ll speak for myself,” Biden said. \n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, said there has been a explosion of anti-government groups known as being part of the so-called Patriot movement. From a 2012 report by SPLC: \n\n\nBut the movement came roaring back beginning in late 2008, just as the economy went south with the subprime collapse and, more importantly, as Barack Obama appeared on the political scene as the Democratic nominee and, ultimately, the president-elect. Even as most of the nation cheered the election of the first black president that November, an angry backlash developed that included several plots to murder Obama. Many Americans, infused with populist fury over bank and auto bailouts and a feeling that they had lost their country, joined Patriot groups.\n\nThe swelling of the Patriot movement since that time has been astounding. From 149 groups in 2008, the number of Patriot organizations skyrocketed to 512 in 2009, shot up again in 2010 to 824, and then, last year, jumped to 1,274. That works out to a staggering 755% growth in the three years ending last Dec. 31. Last year’s total was more than 400 groups higher than the prior all-time high, in 1996.\n\n\nMany African-Americans have also been frustrated with a long-running attempt to delegitimize the first black president by claiming he wasn’t born in the United States and therefore isn’t really eligible to be president. They argue that these sorts of arguments wouldn’t be used ― and haven’t been used ― against a white president. \n\n“It’s a dog whistle to all Americans, especially African-Americans,” Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) said last month. “If indeed Barack Obama is not intelligent, if indeed Barack Obama is not legitimate, then you striving up the corporate ladder, or striving to achieve something ... how can you feel good about yourself as a sixth-grader if you’re an African-American?”\n\nAlready, this campaign season has seen sexism like no other in recent memory. Donald Trump has accused Clinton of playing the “woman card” and said she doesn’t look “presidential.” \n\nMore recently, the discussion of the race has been focused around whether the nation will elect a man who has bragged about sexually assaulting women ― and has been accused of doing so by numerous women. Trump has responded by insulting the looks of his accusers, saying they are too ugly to have attracted his notice in the first place. \n\nHUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

A l'occasion de sa première convention près de Lille durant laquelle il a exposé ses priorités programmatiques, Jean-Luc Mélenchon s'est expliqué sur le choix de la lettre grecque \"Phi\" pour incarner son mouvement.\"Les uns verront un petit bonhomme qui ferme le poing, d'autres le signal symbolisé d'un genre féminisé, d'autres verront ce qu'ils veulent au fond\", a-t-il déclaré ce dimanche devant les quelques mille conventionnels dont les deux tiers avaient été tirés au sort.\n\n\n\n\nNotre nouveau symbole est un \"phi\" grec, comme le #Fi de \"France insoumise\". #LilleFi https://t.co/ly9EurBzsg pic.twitter.com/GoyW96OysS\n— Jean-Luc Mélenchon (@JLMelenchon) 16 octobre 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Cette France insoumise, FI, nous la disons en grec, Phi, par affection pour ceux qui nous ont appris la démocratie\" et enseigné \"ce miracle de l'explosion de la philosophie\", a plaidé le candidat à l'élection présidentielle.\n\n\n\n\"Aujourd'hui pour toute la terre la France s'appelle Révolution ; et désormais ce mot, Révolution, sera le nom de la civilisation jusqu'à ce qu'il soit remplacé par le mot Harmonie.\"\n\n\n\nCitant Victor Hugo, Jean-Luc Mélenchon a rappelé que Phi désignait aussi le nombre d'or, érigé en symbole d'harmonie entre les hommes et les femmes, entre les être humains \"comme on le dit d'une musique\".\n\n\nAppuyant sa démonstration, l'eurodéputé a estimé que dans la proportion parfaite du nombre d'or, \"le plus grand est dans le même rapport au plus petit qu'au tout. Comme l'est chaque être humain par rapport à son voisin, et notamment le plus démuni au reste de l'univers\".\n\n\nEt de conclure: \"Phi, c'est la philosophie, c'est l'amour de la sagesse. Ça va comme programme!\"\n\n\n\n\nMélenchon revient sur son nouveau logo, la lettre phi.

The latest round of accusations began in earnest Wednesday night and Thursday, the last two days of the polls. As more allegations emerge, the numbers could continue to shift.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The polls also don&rsquo;t differ much in their partisan makeup. A different number of Democrats and Republicans in the polls would cause the numbers to differ, but the polls are strikingly similar on this metric. The ABC/Washington Post poll is made up of 33 percent Democrats, 33 percent independents and 25 percent Republicans. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll is 35 percent Democrats, 33 percent independents and 26 percent Republicans. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The HuffPost Pollster aggregate shows Clinton leading Trump by nearly 8 points in a </span><a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two-way contest</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and by about 6 points in the </span><a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton-vs-johnson\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">four-way race</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These two polls aren&rsquo;t likely to shift that much, since they average out to a 7.5 percent Clinton edge. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll has tracked the fluctuations in the race over the last 10 days. In a poll conducted last weekend, in the immediate aftermath of the tape release, </span><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/poll-after-trump-tape-revelation-clinton-s-lead-double-digits-n663691\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clinton led by 11 points</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/post-debate-poll-shows-clinton-holding-9-point-lead-over-n664541\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">another day of polling</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after last Sunday&rsquo;s debate took that margin down to 9 points, indicating Trump had regained some ground.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, even if Clinton is only up by 4 points, as the ABC/Washington Post poll suggests, that would translate into a solid Electoral College win. As </span><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/clinton-holds-11-point-national-lead-over-trump-nbc-wsj-n666986\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NBC&rsquo;s Mark Murray pointed out</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Barack Obama won by 4 points over Mitt Romney in 2012. Obama defeated John McCain by 7 points in 2008. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A new </span><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-women-propel-hillary-clinton-into-battleground-lead-over-donald-trump/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CBS News Battleground States poll</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shows Clinton leading by 6 points across the critical states that would contribute to that Electoral College win, with 46 percent support compared to Trump&rsquo;s 40 percent support across 13 states. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The poll broke out results in Nevada and Utah separately. Clinton leads 46-40 in Nevada, with 4 percent for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and 5 percent for &ldquo;someone else.&rdquo; The state has been very close over most of the campaign, but Clinton is gaining. According to the </span><a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-nevada-president-trump-vs-clinton\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HuffPost Pollster trend</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Clinton has a lead of just over 1 percent.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Utah, Trump has a substantial lead with 37 percent support. Clinton and conservative independent candidate Evan McMullin are tied at 20 percent support.

    "plain_text": "\nNew national polls show that Hillary Clinton is leading, but it’s not clear by how much. An ABC News/Washington Post poll shows the Democratic presidential nominee up by 4 points ― 47-43 ― with little movement over the last few weeks. But an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Clinton leading by 11 points, 48-37 ― a substantial increase in the Democrat’s margin since the beginning of the month. \n\nThe varying results from these high-quality polls highlight the fact that the race is in a state of flux right now.\n\nBoth polls were conducted Oct. 10-13, after the recording came out of GOP nominee Donald Trump discussing kissing and groping women without their consent, but before many of the sexual assault allegations against Trump hit the news. The latest round of accusations began in earnest Wednesday night and Thursday, the last two days of the polls. As more allegations emerge, the numbers could continue to shift.\n\nThe polls also don’t differ much in their partisan makeup. A different number of Democrats and Republicans in the polls would cause the numbers to differ, but the polls are strikingly similar on this metric. The ABC/Washington Post poll is made up of 33 percent Democrats, 33 percent independents and 25 percent Republicans. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll is 35 percent Democrats, 33 percent independents and 26 percent Republicans. \n\nThe HuffPost Pollster aggregate shows Clinton leading Trump by nearly 8 points in a two-way contest, and by about 6 points in the four-way race. These two polls aren’t likely to shift that much, since they average out to a 7.5 percent Clinton edge.  \n\nThe NBC/Wall Street Journal poll has tracked the fluctuations in the race over the last 10 days. In a poll conducted last weekend, in the immediate aftermath of the tape release, Clinton led by 11 points. But another day of polling after last Sunday’s debate took that margin down to 9 points, indicating Trump had regained some ground.\n\nStill, even if Clinton is only up by 4 points, as the ABC/Washington Post poll suggests, that would translate into a solid Electoral College win. As NBC’s Mark Murray pointed out, Barack Obama won by 4 points over Mitt Romney in 2012. Obama defeated John McCain by 7 points in 2008.  \n\nA new CBS News Battleground States poll shows Clinton leading by 6 points across the critical states that would contribute to that Electoral College win, with 46 percent support compared to Trump’s 40 percent support across 13 states. \n\nThe poll broke out results in Nevada and Utah separately. Clinton leads 46-40 in Nevada, with 4 percent for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and 5 percent for “someone else.” The state has been very close over most of the campaign, but Clinton is gaining. According to the HuffPost Pollster trend, Clinton has a lead of just over 1 percent. \n\nIn Utah, Trump has a substantial lead with 37 percent support. Clinton and conservative independent candidate Evan McMullin are tied at 20 percent support. The HuffPost Pollster trend shows McMullin gaining ground, but Trump still has a 12-point lead over Clinton and a 20-point lead over the independent candidate in the state.\n\nBased on national and state polls, Clinton is the strong favorite to win the election on Nov. 8. The HuffPost forecast puts her chances of winning at 91.5 percent. ",

He has been charged by the FBI and Boston U.S. Attorney’s Office with financial damage to Boston Children’s Hospital as part of a high-profile campaign to free then-fifteen-year-old mitochondrial disease patient Justina Pelletier.

Justina’s parents were also bound by a gag order, forbidding them from speaking with the media, which her father disobeyed stating her life was at stake. </p>\n<h1>“No one was on my side there.

He says he was unable to finish the report prior to his hunger strike. The incidents of abuse in the report are mostly drawn from U.S. Congressional record, including reports from the Government Accountability Office.</p><div class=\"embed-asset embed\" data-type=\"embed-asset\" data-provider=\"Embed\" data-title=\"\">\n<div class=\"embed-code\"><div><div style=\"left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75.0019%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRWEh-qIiUM?wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;start=930\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\"></iframe></div></div></div></div>\n     <blockquote>-Greg Kutz, Managing Director of Forensic Audits and Special Investigations for the GAO, testifying before a congressional hearing.</blockquote>\n<h1>“I would say that’s pretty severe abuse bordering on torture.

More than a year after Ortiz’s office had Swartz charged with what many technologists consider lawful activism, he took his own life.

The White House commented on his death saying, “Aaron Swartz’s death was a tragic, unthinkable loss for his family and friends.

He has released the following modified statement, explaining his motives:</p>\n<p>“After seeing and hearing of so many such atrocities against children, understanding the struggle of advocates and survivors against already seemingly impossible odds and now witnessing how little has changes as a result of the last tragic prosecution of an activist in Boston under the CFAA, it would be intolerable to allow Carmen Ortiz to rewrite history.”</p><p><em>Martin Gottesfeld contributed to this article from federal pre-trial detention.

    "plain_text": "\nAlleged Anonymous Hacker Martin Gottesfeld is nearing the third week of his hunger strike. On day 11, he has lost 14 pounds, but remains in good spirits and with high hopes.\n\n“As journalists dig further into the relevant issues, and especially what happened to Justina, I am confident I will get the pledges,” Gottesfeld said.\n\nGottesfeld was arrested in February after his motorboat encountered problems and he and his wife were rescued by Disney cruises. He has been charged by the FBI and Boston U.S. Attorney’s Office with financial damage to Boston Children’s Hospital as part of a high-profile campaign to free then-fifteen-year-old mitochondrial disease patient Justina Pelletier. No patients are alleged to have been harmed.\n\nThe Huffington Post previously covered Gottesfeld’s case, and published the announcement of a hunger strike.\n\nHe and others, including a former Boston Children’s Hospital nurse, as well as a former federal prosecutor (who happens to be the longest-tenured member and of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,) assert the hospital abused Justina and other children in similar situations.\n\nGottesfeld submitted a lengthy report to the United Nations and U.S. Department of Justice, citing numerous media sources, including interviews with Justina and her family.\n\n     One of those interviews with the local PBS station\n“She’s been in severe pain non-stop 24 hours a day for 13 months.”\n– Lou Pelletier, Justina’s father \nThe allegations against Boston Children’s include the holding withholding of pain, cardiac, and brain medications; seclusion (similar to solitary confinement); the limiting, monitoring, and censoring of family communications; lack of education; and withholding of religious services. Justina’s parents were also bound by a gag order, forbidding them from speaking with the media, which her father disobeyed stating her life was at stake. \n“No one was on my side there. No one believed me there. Everyone thought I was faking that all this medical stuff. They stopped all my medicine.” \n– Justina Pelletier , former Boston Children’s Hospital patient\n\nNow, Gottesfeld has released a partial report about other children in the American “troubled teen industry,” made up of for-profit juvenile boot camps, wilderness programs, residential treatment and detention centers. He says he was unable to finish the report prior to his hunger strike. The incidents of abuse in the report are mostly drawn from U.S. Congressional record, including reports from the Government Accountability Office.\n\n     -Greg Kutz, Managing Director of Forensic Audits and Special Investigations for the GAO, testifying before a congressional hearing.\n“I would say that’s pretty severe abuse bordering on torture. I’m not sure what the distinction is between abuse and torture, but certainly in some cases I would define it as torture, what we saw.”\n– Greg Kutz, Managing Director Forensic Audits and Special Investigations for the GAO\n\nAmong other things, the GAO found children starved and malnourished to death, being put in simulated hangings, and dying from physical restraints. One staffer trained his pit bull to bite children in the crotch on command. Nationally, there are over a thousand such allegations every year.\n“Staff routinely broke and wired shut the jaws of youth who showed disrespect in another facility.”\n-Kay E. Brown, Director of Education, Workforce, and Income Security Issues for the GAO\n\nGottesfeld is demanding a pledge from presidential candidates to address what one congressman called “this nightmare of abuse and neglect.” He is also demanding that U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, previously covered by The Huffington Post, stop what he calls political prosecutions.\n\nOrtiz oversaw the case against noted Internet activist and Reddit co-founder Aaron Swartz. More than a year after Ortiz’s office had Swartz charged with what many technologists consider lawful activism, he took his own life. The case sparked national outrage, 61,000 signatures on a WhiteHouse.gov petition demanding her termination. The White House commented on his death saying, “Aaron Swartz’s death was a tragic, unthinkable loss for his family and friends. Our sympathy continues to go out to those who were closest to him, and to the many others whose lives he touched.”\n\n     A documentary about Swartz entitled “The Internet’s Own Boy”\n\nMore recently, Ortiz has drawn scrutiny and criticism for indicting aids in Boston Mayor Marty Walsh’s office. Their alleged crime is insisting that outside concert producers hire union labor. NPR has published on the issue.\n\nGottesfeld is now on day 11 of his hunger strike and reports losing 14 lbs. Supporters have launched www.FreeMartyG.com, as well as a facebook page, and twitter account. He has released the following modified statement, explaining his motives:\n\n“After seeing and hearing of so many such atrocities against children, understanding the struggle of advocates and survivors against already seemingly impossible odds and now witnessing how little has changes as a result of the last tragic prosecution of an activist in Boston under the CFAA, it would be intolerable to allow Carmen Ortiz to rewrite history.”\nMartin Gottesfeld contributed to this article from federal pre-trial detention. Dana Gottesfeld is his wife. ",

    "plain_text": "\n\n     \nVice President Joe Biden dismissed Donald Trump’s “locker room talk” excuse Sunday morning, saying guys he knew in locker rooms don’t brag about sexually assaulting women.\n\n“The vast majority of men don’t share the view of Donald Trump. I played ― I was a pretty good athlete in high school, college. I don’t ever remember that kind of locker room talk, never,” Biden said in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press. “You might have a guy say, ‘Boy, look at that,’ or ‘Dude’ or make some comments like that. But the idea that, ‘She lets me do anything because I’m a celebrity’ is just sick.”\n\nBiden was referring to leaked video from 2005, in which Trump talked about using his celebrity status to assault women without their consent: “Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.”\n\nTrump has since said that he doesn’t actually do what he boasted of in that video.  \n\n“I don’t think you understood what was — this was locker room talk,” Trump said in the most recent debate. “I’m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I’m not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.”\n\nTrump was not in a locker room at the time of his remarks; he was on an “Access Hollywood” bus for a professional appearance.\n\nAthletes have also stepped forward and said that comments like Trump’s are not what most men talk about in locker rooms.\n\nI'm offended as an athlete that @realDonaldTrump keeps using this \"locker room talk\" as an excuse.— Robbie Rogers (@robbierogers) October 10, 2016\n\n     \n\nAs an athlete, I've been in locker rooms my entire adult life and uh, that's not locker room talk.— Sean Doolittle (@whatwouldDOOdo) October 10, 2016\n\n     \n\nYes. That's not locker room talk. https://t.co/egzC03ooQA— Chris Kluwe (@ChrisWarcraft) October 10, 2016\n\n     \n\nI have 2 daughters and agree. spent a good chunk of my life in locker rooms and learned u can tell a lot abt a person by what they say there https://t.co/1fL5KXqzyi— James Blake (@JRBlake) October 8, 2016\n\n     \nSince Trump’s remarks at the debate, a steady stream of women have stepped forward to say that Trump sexually assaulted them. Trump has responded by saying they are part of a conspiracy against him and arguing that they are too ugly for him to assault. \n\nIn an interview Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.) said unequivocally that Hillary Clinton’s campaign was not at all involved in the women coming forward.\n\n“As soon as he looked folks in the face and said those were not my actions,” Kaine said, “that was essentially the invitation to people who knew otherwise to come out and say, ‘Wait a minute, I’d had an experience with Donald Trump.’”\n\nHUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Please I beg you to stop all of this, you do not have any proof of who killed him,” the post read.\n\nThe state’s black bear hunting season ended on Saturday. A total of 549 bears were killed over the six-day period, according to the state’s online records.\n\nThe hunt is designed to maintain the bear populations and enhance public safety, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection.",

    "plain_text": "\nLONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - The United States and Britain called on Sunday for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in Yemen to end violence between Iran-backed Houthis and the government, which is supported by Gulf states.\n\nA Saudi-led campaign in Yemen has come under heavy criticism since an air strike a week ago on a funeral gathering in the Yemeni capital Sanaa that killed 140 people according to a United Nations’ estimate and 82 according to the Houthis.\n\nOn Saturday, a U.S. admiral said a destroyer had again been targeted in the Red Sea in an apparent failed missile attack launched from the coast of Yemen.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said if Yemen’s opposing sides accepted the ceasefire then the special envoy to the U.N., Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, would work through the details and announce when and how it would take effect.\n\n“This is the time to implement a ceasefire unconditionally and then move to the negotiating table,” Kerry told reporters.\n\n“We cannot emphasize enough today the urgency of ending the violence in Yemen,” he said after meeting British foreign minister, Boris Johnson, and other officials in London.\n\nKerry said they were calling for the implementation of the ceasefire “as rapidly as possible, meaning Monday, Tuesday.”\n\nJohnson said the conflict in Yemen was “causing increasing international concern; the fatalities that we’re seeing there are unacceptable.”\n\n“There should be a ceasefire and the U.N. should lead the way in calling for that ceasefire.”\n\nTheir call came after meetings in London with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir and senior UAE officials.\n\nKerry met Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif on Saturday in Switzerland on the sidelines of Syria talks.\n\n“It is a crisis now of enormous proportions with an increasing economic, increasing humanitarian and health crisis, and obviously the military components are troubling to everybody,” Kerry said.\n\n“We have over the last days been in touch with the parties. I have talked with the foreign minister of Oman, as well as with the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and UAE, and everybody agrees the moment calls for moving forward with efforts to try and deescalate and find a way forward.”",

The intelligence community put out an extraordinary statement on Oct. 7 saying it was &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national\" target=\"_blank\">confident</a>&rdquo; Russia was behind the hacks of emails that have ended up on WikiLeaks, including emails from the Democratic National Committee and top <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/hillary-clinton/\">Hillary Clinton</a> campaign official John Podesta.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia&rsquo;s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,&rdquo; read the joint statement from the intelligence community.</p>\n<p>But Pence&rsquo;s running mate, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>, has refused to accept the conclusions of the intelligence community, even as he receives private briefings from analysts.</p>\n<p>In the first debate, when evidence was already building pointing to Russia, Trump defended the country ― <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/136635/donald-trump-cant-stop-praising-vladimir-putin\" target=\"_blank\">as he does so often</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC,&rdquo; Trump said. &ldquo;[Clinton&rsquo;s] saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don&rsquo;t &mdash; maybe it was.

    "plain_text": "\n\n     \nGOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence admitted Sunday morning that it appears increasingly likely Russia has been meddling in U.S. elections by hacking into public officials’ email accounts. \n\n“I think there’s no question that the evidence continues to point in that direction, and we should follow it where it leads,” Pence, who is currently Indiana governor, said in an interview on “Fox News Sunday.” “And there should be severe consequences to Russia or any sovereign nation that is compromising the privacy or the security of the United States of America.”\n\nOn NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday, Pence added, “I think there’s more and more evidence that implicates Russia, and there should be serious consequences.”\n\nThat position shouldn’t be noteworthy. The intelligence community put out an extraordinary statement on Oct. 7 saying it was “confident” Russia was behind the hacks of emails that have ended up on WikiLeaks, including emails from the Democratic National Committee and top Hillary Clinton campaign official John Podesta. \n\n“We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,” read the joint statement from the intelligence community.\n\nBut Pence’s running mate, Donald Trump, has refused to accept the conclusions of the intelligence community, even as he receives private briefings from analysts.\n\nIn the first debate, when evidence was already building pointing to Russia, Trump defended the country ― as he does so often. \n\n“I don’t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC,” Trump said. “[Clinton’s] saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don’t — maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?”\n\nIn the second debate, Trump suggested there might not be any hacking at all, and everyone pointing to Russia might simply be conspiring against him. \n\n“I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are — she doesn’t know if it’s the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking,” he said. “But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they’re trying to tarnish me with Russia.”\n\nRetired Gen. Michael Hayden, who previously headed the CIA and the National Security Agency, said Trump’s head-in-the-sand stance “defies logic.” He also said Trump would likely continue this practice of ignoring experts if elected president.\n\n“He seems to ignore their advice,” Hayden told The Washington Post. “Why would you assume this would change when he is in office?”\n\n \n\nEditor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.\n\nWant more updates from Amanda?

    "content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We play for the Amherst College men&rsquo;s soccer team, the defending NCAA Division III National Champions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our locker room consists of 31 guys, ages 18 to 23. We come from 13 different states and five different countries. We grew up with different religions, ethnicities, cultures, and socio-economic backgrounds. We study political science, economics, computer science, biology, history, physics and black studies. We grew up playing on countless different clubs, traveling teams, and high-school soccer teams &ndash; each with its own distinct culture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is what we talk about in o</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ur locker room: </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We talk about the impossible chemistry midterm exam we had that morning, the new idea for our senior thesis, the buffalo chicken wraps for lunch, and how the other teams in the league did that weekend. We also talk about our Saturday nights, our personal relationships and, of course, the girls in our lives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, despite our diverse backgrounds, upbringings and interests, we cannot imagine one of our 30 guys ever making or condoning, in our private locker room, comments similar to Donald Trump&rsquo;s disgusting statements about sexually assaulting women. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We do not know what locker room Donald Trump uses. It clearly doesn&rsquo;t represent the one we use every day. Having had the opportunity to play teams from up and down the east coast, as well as teams from Texas and Iowa in the national tournament, we believe it&rsquo;s not their locker rooms either.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our locker room also differs from Donald Trump&rsquo;s locker room in another respect. It is just down the hall from the locker room of the Amherst women&rsquo;s soccer team. We are good friends with these women; we practice every day on the same field; we watch their games, and they watch ours. We see each other as peers.</span></p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n<span class=\"quote\">We do not know what locker room Donald Trump uses. It clearly doesn’t represent the one we use every day.</span>\n\n</blockquote>\n     <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a sports team, we have found success by valuing the ideal of doing the right thing even when no one is watching. This ideal applies not just to athletic competition, but equally to respecting people: respect is not simply an act you put on for people in the room with you; it is how you speak about them when they are not present.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know that college sports athletes throughout the country have been involved in many cases of sexual abuse. It is absolutely unacceptable that 1 in 5 women on college campuses experience sexual abuse. This needs to change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One part of creating this necessary change is changing how women are talked about &ndash; both in public and in private. Our team is by no means perfect on these fronts, but we want to be part of the solution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We strive to not only keep this kind of offensive talk out of our locker rooms, we also try to actively prevent it elsewhere. We and the other teams at Amherst have made it a priority to speak out and campaign against sexual violence. Our team facilitates sexual respect workshops, participates in campus dialogues about sexual assault and has promoted awareness projects by helping to publicly share stories and messages written by victims of sexual violence. &nbsp;We know this is only a start &ndash; our team, and other teams need to do so much more to make our campus and our community safer and more respectful places for all women.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Donald Trump defended his comments by saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not proud of my locker room talk. But this world has serious problems. We need serious leaders.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Serious leaders take the issue of sexual assault seriously. Sexual assault is a crime. Bragging about sexual assault can </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">never</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> be excused as being what boys and men talk about behind closed doors. To excuse such behavior is to perpetuate a culture of abuse of power that has no place in 21</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">st-</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">century America.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Donald Trump wants to know what actually is said in real locker rooms, he is welcome to visit ours to understand how real men speak about and treat women.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David Lander is a senior at Amherst College and a member of the Amherst Men&rsquo;s Soccer Team.

    "plain_text": "\nThat is not our locker room. \n\nWe play for the Amherst College men’s soccer team, the defending NCAA Division III National Champions.\n\nOur locker room consists of 31 guys, ages 18 to 23. We come from 13 different states and five different countries. We grew up with different religions, ethnicities, cultures, and socio-economic backgrounds. We study political science, economics, computer science, biology, history, physics and black studies. We grew up playing on countless different clubs, traveling teams, and high-school soccer teams – each with its own distinct culture. \n\nHere is what we talk about in our locker room: We talk about the impossible chemistry midterm exam we had that morning, the new idea for our senior thesis, the buffalo chicken wraps for lunch, and how the other teams in the league did that weekend. We also talk about our Saturday nights, our personal relationships and, of course, the girls in our lives. \n\nBut, despite our diverse backgrounds, upbringings and interests, we cannot imagine one of our 30 guys ever making or condoning, in our private locker room, comments similar to Donald Trump’s disgusting statements about sexually assaulting women. \n\nWe do not know what locker room Donald Trump uses. It clearly doesn’t represent the one we use every day. Having had the opportunity to play teams from up and down the east coast, as well as teams from Texas and Iowa in the national tournament, we believe it’s not their locker rooms either.\n\nOur locker room also differs from Donald Trump’s locker room in another respect. It is just down the hall from the locker room of the Amherst women’s soccer team. We are good friends with these women; we practice every day on the same field; we watch their games, and they watch ours. We see each other as peers.\nWe do not know what locker room Donald Trump uses. It clearly doesn’t represent the one we use every day.\n\n\n     \nAs a sports team, we have found success by valuing the ideal of doing the right thing even when no one is watching. This ideal applies not just to athletic competition, but equally to respecting people: respect is not simply an act you put on for people in the room with you; it is how you speak about them when they are not present.\n\nWe know that college sports athletes throughout the country have been involved in many cases of sexual abuse. It is absolutely unacceptable that 1 in 5 women on college campuses experience sexual abuse. This needs to change. \n\nOne part of creating this necessary change is changing how women are talked about – both in public and in private. Our team is by no means perfect on these fronts, but we want to be part of the solution.\n\nWe strive to not only keep this kind of offensive talk out of our locker rooms, we also try to actively prevent it elsewhere. We and the other teams at Amherst have made it a priority to speak out and campaign against sexual violence. Our team facilitates sexual respect workshops, participates in campus dialogues about sexual assault and has promoted awareness projects by helping to publicly share stories and messages written by victims of sexual violence.  We know this is only a start – our team, and other teams need to do so much more to make our campus and our community safer and more respectful places for all women.\n\nDonald Trump defended his comments by saying, “I’m not proud of my locker room talk. But this world has serious problems. We need serious leaders.”\n\nSerious leaders take the issue of sexual assault seriously. Sexual assault is a crime. Bragging about sexual assault can never be excused as being what boys and men talk about behind closed doors. To excuse such behavior is to perpetuate a culture of abuse of power that has no place in 21st-century America.\n\nIf Donald Trump wants to know what actually is said in real locker rooms, he is welcome to visit ours to understand how real men speak about and treat women.\n\nDavid Lander is a senior at Amherst College and a member of the Amherst Men’s Soccer Team. This op-ed speaks on behalf of the team.",

Delegates at the talks would likely ratify the decision on Monday, the statement said.\n\nUNC president Vital Kamerhe is widely expected to become prime minister as part of the power-sharing government ushered in under the talks.\n\nKabila, who came to power in 2001 when his father was assassinated, says he will respect the constitution but has yet to rule out attempting to change the country’s laws to enable him to run for a fresh term.\n\nThe presidents of neighboring Rwanda and Congo Republic changed their constitutions last year to allow themselves to stand for a third term, and Kabila’s opponents say they fear he will do the same.\n\nHundreds of people have also died since last year in neighboring Burundi after its president Pierre Nkurunziza pursued and won a third term in office that his opponents say is unconstitutional.\n\nThe head of the U.N. mission in Congo warned last week that the political impasse poses an “extreme risk” to stability. Millions died in regional conflicts between 1996 and 2003 and Congo has never experience a peaceful transition of power.",

    "content": "<strong><em>Twenty-four years ago, a concert predicted Dylan's future as a Nobel Laureate.</em></strong>\n\nBob Dylan is officially the songwriter with the most bling. He's got plaques, statues, gramophones, and now a Nobel Prize in Literature. True to form, the Minnesota-born singer performed a career-spanning set at the Desert Trip music festival in California Friday night but never mentioned the amazing honor bestowed upon him Thursday morning. What a rock and roll thing to do: ignore the elephant in the room simply by being the bigger elephant. He's more decorated than Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Pete Townshend and Neil Young. With his new prize, Dylan has won the crown for all time. For America.\n\nBut if Dylan is a living, breathing national hero, why have we been eulogizing him since he was a young man, almost as if he was dead ?\n\nI first asked this question when I attended a 30th anniversary Dylan tribute concert at Madison Square Garden. It was October 16, 1992, and the marquee read, \"Columbia Records Celebrates the Music of Bob Dylan featuring Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan and George Harrison.\" Sexy Clapton got top billing because he had a current single on the charts (\"Tears in Heaven\"). In third place came sweet George the Beatle, because ... well, he was one of the Traveling Wilburys, John was dead, and Paul's brilliance had yet to be re-evaluated by the media. The poet in the middle of the lineup was the man himself, the Bob who could care less where they put his name. \n\nThe event would turn out to be one the greatest musical experiences of my life. Yet, what puzzled me is that Dylan was only 51 years old when the concert happened. The stage was full of many performers who also deserved their own tributes, including Harrison, Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, Lou Reed and others. Most of the artists in the Garden for the gig were considered dinosaurs of rock even though many were only in their 30s and 40s. Tickets to the Dylan celebration were sold to the public and a live album charted after the event, but the buzz from both fizzled fast. \n\nSo, why did we honor Dylan in 1992, thirty years after his first song was released? \n\nIn the age of Nirvana and hip hop, a tribute to the man who wrote about wind, war, and watchtowers felt as countercultural as Dylan's music did when it disrupted the bobby-socks crooning of the early 1960s. He represented Americana, eschewed fame, maintained mystery, and generally didn't (and still doesn't) give a damn. That warm October night at the tribute concert, with thousands of fans and dozens of artists trying to find their way in the industry and the world, Bob Dylan was the equivalent of a musical guide rope. He was still a rebel, but a familiar one. Maybe we honored him because we finally felt comfortable in his company: by doing so, we left the boundaries of rock and roll for wider vistas. \n\nOn the radio in the autumn of 1992, a love song called \"The End of the Road\" topped the <em>Billboard </em>charts for thirteen weeks, including on the day of the Dylan tribute. At the time, I thought of the song as a metaphor for the passing of the music written by Dylan and his ilk, the generation of socially-conscious musicians who opened pathways for future performers to create their own revolutions. Now I realize the Dylan concert at Madison Square Garden didn't represent the death of an era of music but instead offered a change in our perception of genres. \n\nTimes are forever \"a-changin,\" as the Dylan song says, which is why it's important to pause and honor the change, honor what's leaving, what's here, and what's to come. That's what the 30th anniversary concert did--it was a pause. There, I heard my idol Steve Wonder sing his version of \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and watched my favorites Shawn Colvin, Mary Chapin Carpenter and Rosanne Cash perform \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere.\" Eddie Vedder and Mike McCready reinvented \"Masters of War\" for Generation X. Listen to the lyrics of Dylan's most famous songs today, and they could be about Syria, Haiti, Yemen, Nigeria or even the absurdity in Washington, DC. \n\nAlthough I'd worked in a record store for years and wrote about music for magazines, I never understood Dylan until a parade of voices explained him to me in song at the Garden. The next day, I filed a report to my hometown South Carolina paper, mostly bragging about meeting Harrison, Reed and Tom Petty backstage, but I wish they'd printed what I put in my journal that night: <em>Bob Dylan makes sense.</em>\n\nWhen I read the news about Dylan winning the Nobel Prize in Literature this week, I felt another change in the air, a positive shift for 2016. I totally disagree with the notion that Dylan's win equals a loss for \"serious\" literature. The Nobel organization's acknowledgement of Dylan's work means we haven't forgotten the verses that got us here. Life today is explained in Twitter's 140 characters, Snapchat selfies, Facebook memes and pop songs written by robots and algorithms. But we shouldn't say that the old ways of communicating are dead. Lyrics are poetry, music is art, literature can be all of the above. Elements of culture may be examined and deemed worthy even if they are not created in the style of the present or the distant past. This is how younger generations rediscovered Dylan in 1992 and will do so again now. \n\nInstead of eulogizing the poet and sounding a death knell for a musical genre he helped popularize fifty years ago, let's take a pause to celebrate what Dylan's prize might portend for the future. By doing that, we can better appreciate the value and meaning of all words.\n\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-10-15-1476551855-7730457-wideshotdylan.png\"><img alt=\"2016-10-15-1476551855-7730457-wideshotdylan.png\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-10-15-1476551855-7730457-wideshotdylan-thumb.png\" width=\"570\" height=\"317\" /></a>\n<em>From Columbia Records Celebrates the Music of Bob Dylan \nCredit: Fair Use /MDCA</em> ",

    "plain_text": "Twenty-four years ago, a concert predicted Dylan's future as a Nobel Laureate.\n\nBob Dylan is officially the songwriter with the most bling. He's got plaques, statues, gramophones, and now a Nobel Prize in Literature. True to form, the Minnesota-born singer performed a career-spanning set at the Desert Trip music festival in California Friday night but never mentioned the amazing honor bestowed upon him Thursday morning. What a rock and roll thing to do: ignore the elephant in the room simply by being the bigger elephant. He's more decorated than Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Pete Townshend and Neil Young. With his new prize, Dylan has won the crown for all time. For America.\n\nBut if Dylan is a living, breathing national hero, why have we been eulogizing him since he was a young man?\n\nI first asked this question when I attended a 30th anniversary Dylan tribute concert at Madison Square Garden. It was October 16, 1992, and the marquee read, \"Columbia Records Celebrates the Music of Bob Dylan featuring Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan and George Harrison.\" Sexy Clapton got top billing because he had a current single on the charts (\"Tears in Heaven\"). In third place came sweet George the Beatle, because ... well, he was one of the Traveling Wilburys, John was dead, and Paul's brilliance had yet to be re-evaluated by the media. The poet in the middle of the lineup was the man himself, the Bob who could care less where they put his name. \n\nThe event would turn out to be one the greatest musical experiences of my life. Yet, what puzzled me is that Dylan was only 51 years old when the concert happened. The stage was full of many performers who also deserved their own tributes, including Harrison, Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, Lou Reed and others. Most of the artists in the Garden for the gig were considered dinosaurs of rock even though many were only in their 30s and 40s. Tickets to the Dylan celebration were sold to the public and a live album charted after the event, but the buzz from both fizzled fast. \n\nSo, why did we honor Dylan in 1992, thirty years after his first song was released? \n\nIn the age of Nirvana and hip hop, a tribute to the man who wrote about wind, war, and watchtowers felt as countercultural as Dylan's music did when it disrupted the bobby-socks crooning of the early 1960s. He represented Americana, eschewed fame, maintained mystery, and generally didn't (and still doesn't) give a damn. That warm October night at the tribute concert, with thousands of fans and dozens of artists trying to find their way in the industry and the world, Bob Dylan was the equivalent of a musical guide rope. He was still a rebel, but a familiar one. Maybe we honored him because we finally felt comfortable in his company: by doing so, we left the boundaries of rock and roll for wider vistas. \n\nOn the radio in the autumn of 1992, a love song called \"The End of the Road\" topped the Billboard charts for thirteen weeks, including on the day of the Dylan tribute. At the time, I thought of the song as a metaphor for the passing of the music written by Dylan and his ilk, the generation of socially-conscious musicians who opened pathways for future performers to create their own revolutions. Now I realize the Dylan concert at Madison Square Garden didn't represent the death of an era of music but instead offered a change in our perception of genres. \n\nTimes are forever \"a-changin,\" as the Dylan song says, which is why it's important to pause and honor the change, honor what's leaving, what's here, and what's to come. That's what the 30th anniversary concert did--it was a pause. There, I heard my idol Steve Wonder sing his version of \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and watched my favorites Shawn Colvin, Mary Chapin Carpenter and Rosanne Cash perform \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere.\" Listen to the lyrics of Dylan's most famous songs today, and they could be about Syria, Haiti, Yemen, Nigeria or even the absurdity in Washington, DC. \n\nAlthough I'd worked in a record store for years and wrote about music for magazines, I never understood Dylan until a parade of voices explained him to me in song at the Garden. The next day, I filed a report to my hometown South Carolina paper, mostly bragging about meeting Harrison, Reed and Tom Petty backstage, but I wish they'd printed what I put in my journal that night: Bob Dylan makes sense.\n\nWhen I read the news about Dylan winning the Nobel Prize in Literature this week, I felt another change in the air, a positive shift for 2016. I totally disagree with the notion that Dylan's win equals a loss for \"serious\" literature. The Nobel organization's acknowledgement of Dylan's work means we haven't forgotten the verses that got us here. Life today is explained in Twitter's 140 characters, Snapchat selfies, Facebook memes and pop songs written by robots and algorithms. But we shouldn't say that the old ways of communicating are dead. Lyrics are poetry, music is art, literature can be all of the above. Elements of culture may be examined and deemed worthy even if they are not created in the style of the present or the distant past. This is how younger generations rediscovered Dylan in 1992 and will do so again now. \n\nInstead of eulogizing the poet and sounding a death knell for a musical genre he helped popularize fifty years ago, let's take a pause to celebrate what Dylan's prize might portend for the future. By doing that, we can better appreciate the value and meaning of all words.\n\n\nFrom Columbia Records Celebrates the Music of Bob Dylan \nCredit: Fair Use /MDCA",

    "content": "<p>M&Eacute;DITATION - La m&eacute;ditation de pleine conscience se r&eacute;pand de plus en plus en France (des livres vendus par millions en France, des conf&eacute;rences pleines &agrave; craquer, plus de 370.000 utilisateurs pour l'app mobile de <a href=\"https://www.petitbambou.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Petit BamBou</a>...).<br />\n<br />\nMais qui sont ces m&eacute;ditants? Difficile d'en faire encore un portrait exhaustif. Pourtant, on peut affirmer sans crainte qu'un m&eacute;ditant est souvent un <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/news/ecologie/\" target=\"_blank\">&eacute;colo</a> qui s'ignore: un &eacute;colo de son bien-&ecirc;tre. Car par d&eacute;finition, un &eacute;cologiste d&eacute;veloppe justement au quotidien une conscience plus &eacute;tendue et ouverte, et adopte des comportements responsables. Exactement comme un <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/news/meditation/\" target=\"_blank\">m&eacute;ditant</a>, en cultivant l'habitude de s'asseoir r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement, en silence, pour entra&icirc;ner son attention.</p>\n\n<p><em>Si vous avez 10 minutes par jour &agrave; y consacrer, voici concr&egrave;tement 8 pistes pour m&eacute;diter &eacute;colo:</em></p>\n\n<p><big><strong>1. Ayez des r&eacute;flexes &eacute;colo avec toute votre attention</strong></big></p>\n\n<p>L'attention est une ressource rare qu'il est bon de ne pas gaspiller, et de m&eacute;nager au quotidien. C'est m&ecirc;me la cl&eacute; pour prendre soin de son mental.</p>\n\n<p>M&eacute;diter r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement permet de prendre conscience des polluants psychiques qui ne cessent de disperser et fragmenter son attention. Prenez conscience de votre tendance &agrave; &eacute;puiser votre attention en la sur-sollicitant (par exemple par le multi-tasking ou devant les &eacute;crans en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral). R&eacute;alisez alors que ce temps et cette attention manquent justement pour les &eacute;changes familiaux et professionnels, pour le repos, pour le sommeil... Pour vivre pleinement votre vie en &eacute;tant vraiment pr&eacute;sent.</p>\n\n<p><big><strong>2. Agissez sans attendre la crise</strong></big></p>\n\n<p>L'histoire de l'&eacute;cologie est marqu&eacute;e de prises de conscience &agrave; la suite de crises. Mais pourquoi attendre des &eacute;v&eacute;nements violents ou des crises pour faire changer la soci&eacute;t&eacute;, les lois ou les comportements?</p>\n\n<p>N'attendez pas les soubresauts de la vie pour pr&eacute;parer votre esprit, et pour changer certains comportements durablement. M&eacute;diter est un art de vivre: contentez-vous de contempler et d'accepter certains de vos comportements, attitudes ou sch&eacute;mas mentaux. Des pistes pour les changer durablement pourraient surgir de votre calme int&eacute;rieur. Pour cela essayez de vous rendre r&eacute;ceptif aux id&eacute;es nouvelles et &agrave; vos besoins profonds.</p>\n\n<p><big><strong>3. Soyez plus respectueux de vos besoins et &eacute;quilibres biologiques</strong></big></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/02/09/manger-trop-vite-meditation_n_9087852.html\" target=\"_blank\">Manger en conscience</a> am&egrave;ne &agrave; se r&eacute;concilier avec ses faims, mais aussi &agrave; choisir avec plus de discernement ses aliments et la quantit&eacute; que l'on avale.</p>\n\n<p>Essayez de prendre vos repas en pleine conscience. Il s'agit de manger et de ne faire que cela: sans parler, regarder son smartphone ou regarder la t&eacute;l&eacute;. Sentez bien le go&ucirc;t de chaque aliment, m&acirc;chez tranquillement, &eacute;coutez votre corps alors que la nourriture descend dans votre estomac.</p>\n\n<p><big><strong>4. Respectez votre corps comme la nature</strong></big></p>\n\n<p>M&eacute;diter am&egrave;ne &agrave; &ecirc;tre attentif &agrave; ses sensations corporelles, &agrave; cultiver l'harmonie entre le corps et l'esprit. Imaginez que votre corps est comme la nature autour de vous; il vous accueille en cet instant, remerciez-le pour cela.</p>\n\n<p>Connectez-vous &agrave; votre corps en pr&ecirc;tant r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement attention &agrave; vos sensations corporelles. Vous d&eacute;couvrirez les richesses des liens entre corps et esprit.</p>\n\n<p><big><strong>5. Renouez le lien avec votre environnement</strong></big></p>\n\n<p>M&eacute;diter change sa relation au monde en devenant plus conscient de ce qui se passe en soi, autour de soi et des liens qui nous unissent au monde. Essayez de m&eacute;diter dehors, en marchant dans la nature, en vous asseyant dans un pr&eacute;, et ouvrez-vous &agrave; la possibilit&eacute; d'&ecirc;tre sensible aux sons autour de vous, aux odeurs, aux caresses du vent sur votre peau. Laissez-vous envahir par un sentiment de communion, de fusion, avec le monde ext&eacute;rieur, avec la nature. Laissez-vous &ecirc;tre pleinement pr&eacute;sent, comme faisant partie de la nature autour de vous.</p>\n\n<p>Une autre pratique possible: commencez par vous rendre pr&eacute;sent &agrave; ce qui est l&agrave;. Contemplez vos sensations et observez ce qui se passe autour de vous. Remarquez comment vous observez, respectez, essayez de cohabiter avec l'instant pr&eacute;sent, sans vouloir l'utiliser, le modifier, le contr&ocirc;ler, le poss&eacute;der: c'est un formidable rappel du comportement &agrave; adopter avec la nature!</p>\n\n<p><big><strong>6. Prenez conscience des interd&eacute;pendances</strong></big></p>\n\n<p>Croyez-vous que vous &ecirc;tes parfaitement autonome, isol&eacute;, s&eacute;par&eacute; des autres humains, ou &agrave; l'&eacute;cart de la nature? La nature n'est pas qu'un garde-manger ou une r&eacute;serve d'&eacute;nergie, vos amis ne sont pas l&agrave; que pour vous distraire... Vous d&eacute;pendez et appartenez &agrave; votre <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/news/environnement/\" target=\"_blank\">environnement</a>. L'harmonie dans vos relations avec cet environnement a un r&ocirc;le important sur votre &eacute;panouissement, vos frustrations, et m&ecirc;me votre bonheur ou souffrance. Tout est interd&eacute;pendant, comme le montre l'exemple bien connu en &eacute;cologie: abeille, fleur, arbre fruitier. Essayez, en m&eacute;ditant, de reconna&icirc;tre votre d&eacute;pendance et votre appartenance &agrave; un &eacute;cosyst&egrave;me naturel, social ou relationnel. Cultivez par la pratique r&eacute;guli&egrave;re de la m&eacute;ditation l'altruisme, le partage, l'ouverture aux autres car c'est un formidable moyen d'&ecirc;tre &eacute;colo dans ce contexte!</p>\n\n<p><big><strong>7. Calculez \"l'empreinte de gratitude\" &agrave; chaque petit bonheur du quotidien</strong></big></p>\n\n<p>Tout comme on mesure aujourd'hui l'empreinte carbone de ce qu'on consomme, pourquoi ne pas essayer d'identifier ceux qui vous ont permis de vivre un bon moment et de les remercier mentalement?</p>\n\n<p>Par exemple, quand on se r&eacute;gale lors d'un bon repas, r&eacute;alisez le r&ocirc;le de tous ceux qui ont permis cela (depuis l'agriculteur, au transporteur, au logisticien, aux employ&eacute;s du magasin, aux cuisiniers...). Identifiez-les et prenez quelques instants pour remercier tous les acteurs de la cha&icirc;ne! Envoyez-leur un peu de gratitude. Peu importe que cela soit un circuit court ou long, soyez g&eacute;n&eacute;reux en remerciements.</p>\n\n<p><big><strong>8.

    "plain_text": "\nMÉDITATION - La méditation de pleine conscience se répand de plus en plus en France (des livres vendus par millions en France, des conférences pleines à craquer, plus de 370.000 utilisateurs pour l'app mobile de Petit BamBou...).\n\n\n\nMais qui sont ces méditants? Difficile d'en faire encore un portrait exhaustif. Pourtant, on peut affirmer sans crainte qu'un méditant est souvent un écolo qui s'ignore: un écolo de son bien-être. Car par définition, un écologiste développe justement au quotidien une conscience plus étendue et ouverte, et adopte des comportements responsables. Exactement comme un méditant, en cultivant l'habitude de s'asseoir régulièrement, en silence, pour entraîner son attention.\n\n\nSi vous avez 10 minutes par jour à y consacrer, voici concrètement 8 pistes pour méditer écolo:\n\n\n1. Ayez des réflexes écolo avec toute votre attention\n\n\nL'attention est une ressource rare qu'il est bon de ne pas gaspiller, et de ménager au quotidien. C'est même la clé pour prendre soin de son mental.\n\n\nMéditer régulièrement permet de prendre conscience des polluants psychiques qui ne cessent de disperser et fragmenter son attention. Prenez conscience de votre tendance à épuiser votre attention en la sur-sollicitant (par exemple par le multi-tasking ou devant les écrans en général). Réalisez alors que ce temps et cette attention manquent justement pour les échanges familiaux et professionnels, pour le repos, pour le sommeil... Pour vivre pleinement votre vie en étant vraiment présent.\n\n\n2. Agissez sans attendre la crise\n\n\nL'histoire de l'écologie est marquée de prises de conscience à la suite de crises. Mais pourquoi attendre des événements violents ou des crises pour faire changer la société, les lois ou les comportements?\n\n\nN'attendez pas les soubresauts de la vie pour préparer votre esprit, et pour changer certains comportements durablement. Méditer est un art de vivre: contentez-vous de contempler et d'accepter certains de vos comportements, attitudes ou schémas mentaux. Des pistes pour les changer durablement pourraient surgir de votre calme intérieur. Pour cela essayez de vous rendre réceptif aux idées nouvelles et à vos besoins profonds.\n\n\n3. Soyez plus respectueux de vos besoins et équilibres biologiques\n\n\nManger en conscience amène à se réconcilier avec ses faims, mais aussi à choisir avec plus de discernement ses aliments et la quantité que l'on avale.\n\n\nEssayez de prendre vos repas en pleine conscience. Il s'agit de manger et de ne faire que cela: sans parler, regarder son smartphone ou regarder la télé. Sentez bien le goût de chaque aliment, mâchez tranquillement, écoutez votre corps alors que la nourriture descend dans votre estomac.\n\n\n4. Respectez votre corps comme la nature\n\n\nMéditer amène à être attentif à ses sensations corporelles, à cultiver l'harmonie entre le corps et l'esprit. Imaginez que votre corps est comme la nature autour de vous; il vous accueille en cet instant, remerciez-le pour cela.\n\n\nConnectez-vous à votre corps en prêtant régulièrement attention à vos sensations corporelles. Vous découvrirez les richesses des liens entre corps et esprit.\n\n\n5. Renouez le lien avec votre environnement\n\n\nMéditer change sa relation au monde en devenant plus conscient de ce qui se passe en soi, autour de soi et des liens qui nous unissent au monde. Essayez de méditer dehors, en marchant dans la nature, en vous asseyant dans un pré, et ouvrez-vous à la possibilité d'être sensible aux sons autour de vous, aux odeurs, aux caresses du vent sur votre peau. Laissez-vous envahir par un sentiment de communion, de fusion, avec le monde extérieur, avec la nature. Laissez-vous être pleinement présent, comme faisant partie de la nature autour de vous.\n\n\nUne autre pratique possible: commencez par vous rendre présent à ce qui est là. Contemplez vos sensations et observez ce qui se passe autour de vous. Remarquez comment vous observez, respectez, essayez de cohabiter avec l'instant présent, sans vouloir l'utiliser, le modifier, le contrôler, le posséder: c'est un formidable rappel du comportement à adopter avec la nature!\n\n\n6. Prenez conscience des interdépendances\n\n\nCroyez-vous que vous êtes parfaitement autonome, isolé, séparé des autres humains, ou à l'écart de la nature? La nature n'est pas qu'un garde-manger ou une réserve d'énergie, vos amis ne sont pas là que pour vous distraire... Vous dépendez et appartenez à votre environnement. L'harmonie dans vos relations avec cet environnement a un rôle important sur votre épanouissement, vos frustrations, et même votre bonheur ou souffrance. Tout est interdépendant, comme le montre l'exemple bien connu en écologie: abeille, fleur, arbre fruitier. Essayez, en méditant, de reconnaître votre dépendance et votre appartenance à un écosystème naturel, social ou relationnel. Cultivez par la pratique régulière de la méditation l'altruisme, le partage, l'ouverture aux autres car c'est un formidable moyen d'être écolo dans ce contexte!\n\n\n7. Calculez \"l'empreinte de gratitude\" à chaque petit bonheur du quotidien\n\n\nTout comme on mesure aujourd'hui l'empreinte carbone de ce qu'on consomme, pourquoi ne pas essayer d'identifier ceux qui vous ont permis de vivre un bon moment et de les remercier mentalement?\n\n\nPar exemple, quand on se régale lors d'un bon repas, réalisez le rôle de tous ceux qui ont permis cela (depuis l'agriculteur, au transporteur, au logisticien, aux employés du magasin, aux cuisiniers...). Identifiez-les et prenez quelques instants pour remercier tous les acteurs de la chaîne! Envoyez-leur un peu de gratitude. Peu importe que cela soit un circuit court ou long, soyez généreux en remerciements.\n\n\n8. Reconnaissez certaines de vos tendances matérialistes (acheter, consommer, dépenser... sans vrai besoin) \n\n\nVous pouvez, en méditant régulièrement, commencer à adopter des comportements plus durables écologiquement tout en préservant voire développant votre bien-être personnel.\n\n\nEn méditant formellement ou dans votre quotidien, essayez d'observer et de réguler certaines impulsions matérialistes, notamment centrées sur l'achat ou la possession. Essayez alors de cultiver certaines formes alternatives de contentement (émerveillement de chaque instant, gratitude, bienveillance, altruisme...) pour remplacer subtilement le désir de toujours plus. Essayez de mieux comprendre ce qui est source d'équilibre chez vous, ce qui vous rend véritablement heureux, ce qui fait du bien à votre corps et à votre esprit; vous profiterez alors peut être plus de ce que vous avez déjà et vous développerez des comportements sociaux, nutritifs ou physiques plus bénéfiques. Epicure disait: \"Celui qui ne sait pas se contenter de peu ne sera jamais content de rien.\"\n\n\nMéditer est donc une nouvelle forme d'écologie: une écologie du bien-être. Partez donc vous promener dans la nature ce week-end en repensant à ces paroles de Carlo Gondoni: \"La nature est un professeur universel et sûr pour celui qui l'observe\", ou en écoutant les méditations de l'app de Petit BamBou!\n\n\n\nCet article a été écrit par Petit Bambou.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetit BamBou anime une importante communauté online sur le sujet de la sagesse, l'optimisme et du bien-être.

Il considère que le Président est devenu un émetteur comme un autre dans la sphère politico-médiatique\", explique le potentiel candidat à l'élection présidentielle de 2017, avant d'affirmer qu'il ne croit pas \"au 'président 'normal'. Les Français n'attendent pas cela. Au contraire, un tel concept les déstabilise, les insécurise\", ajoute le fondateur du mouvement En marche!.\n\n\n\"Pour moi, la fonction présidentielle dans la France démocratique contemporaine doit être exercée par quelqu'un qui, sans estimer être la source de toute chose, doit conduire la société à force de convictions, d'actions et donner un sens clair à sa démarche\", explique l'ancien conseiller du chef de l'État.\n\n\nQuand le président devient \"normal\", prévient Emmanuel Macron, \"nous courons un risque politique et institutionnel, mais aussi un risque psychologique collectif, et même un risque pour l'efficacité de l'action\". \"Le peuple français, collectif et politique, peut se retourner très vite parce qu'il est en attente d'un discours qui donne à la fois du sens et des perspectives\", fait valoir l'ex-ministre de l'Économie.\n\n\nJuppé, je t'aime moi non plus\n\n\n\n\n\nInterrogé sur le favori de la primaire à droite Alain Juppé, Emmanuel Macron affirme sa singularité tout en reconnaissant une proximité avec le maire de Bordeaux. \"Je n'aurais pas employé le terme d'identité heureuse. C'est trop statique, trop loin de la réalité et je ne sais pas très bien ce que cela signifie\", explique l'ancien ministre.\n\n\n\"Une identité, par nature, n'est pas 'heureuse' ou 'malheureuse'.

She said the first time, she met with Trump in his office and he kissed her on the mouth, which Zervos rationalized as simply a strange greeting. On a separate occasion, she said she met with Trump at the Beverly Hills Hotel to discuss business opportunities. Instead Trump grabbed her while she sat next to him and began kissing her and touching her breasts, Zervos said in her statement. <strong>Trump later walked her into the bedroom, she told reporters, and &ldquo;began thrusting his genitals.&rdquo;</strong> The two did go on to have dinner and discuss real estate, according to Zervos. When asked why she chose to come forward now, she said: &ldquo;I want to be able to sleep when I&rsquo;m 70.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Trump&rsquo;s response:</strong> Nothing yet.</p>\n<p><strong>When we found out:</strong> October 14, 2016</p>\n<p><strong>When she says it happens:</strong> 2007</p>\n<h4>&nbsp;</h4>\n<h4>Kristin Anderson</h4>\n<p><strong>Her account: </strong>Anderson says she was out at a Manhattan nightclub with friends, sitting on a red velvet couch, when she felt Trump<strong> reach into her skirt and touch her vagina through her underwear,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/woman-says-trump-reached-under-her-skirt-and-groped-her-in-early-1990s/2016/10/14/67e8ff5e-917d-11e6-a6a3-d50061aa9fae_story.html?postshare=1271476464189106&amp;tid=ss_tw\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Post reports</a>.

    "plain_text": "\nOn October 8, The Washington Post published footage from 2005 of serial misogynist Donald Trump bragging that as a famous man, he can get away with anything. Like kissing women without waiting for permission. And grabbing women by the pussy. Trump has defended these comments, repeatedly, as “locker room talk.” When pressed by Anderson Cooper during the second presidential debate, he said that he absolutely had not sexually assaulted women.\n\nBut since Trump’s remarks emerged ― and well before then ― women have shared their allegations of sexual abuse against the Republican presidential nominee. Below is a working list of women who’ve accused him of sexual misconduct. These allegations span more than three decades, from the early 1980s to 2013, and are presented here based on the date they became public. If there are any that we’ve missed, or if you have any tips, e-mail women@huffingtonpost.com. This post will continue to be updated.\n\n *  *  *\nCathy Heller\n\nHer account: Heller, now 63, told The Guardian that the first and only time she interacted with Trump, “he grabbed her, went for a kiss, and grew angry with her as she twisted away.” This was all while Heller was having Mother’s Day brunch at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, with her husband, in-laws and children. She alleges that Trump said, “Oh, come on” when she protested and held her still while he kissed her on the side of the mouth before walking away. A relative who was seated at the table that day confirmed to The Guardian that Trump was “very forceful” and got “in her face.”\n\nTrump’s response: Nothing yet. \n\nWhen we found out: October 15, 2016\n\nWhen she says it happened: Around 1997 (Heller says she is not 100 percent sure)\n\n \nSummer Zervos\n\nHer account: Zervos, a contestant on season five of “The Apprentice” (and a self-described Republican) said in a press conference with attorney Gloria Allred that Trump assaulted her on several occasions. She said the first time, she met with Trump in his office and he kissed her on the mouth, which Zervos rationalized as simply a strange greeting. On a separate occasion, she said she met with Trump at the Beverly Hills Hotel to discuss business opportunities. Instead Trump grabbed her while she sat next to him and began kissing her and touching her breasts, Zervos said in her statement. Trump later walked her into the bedroom, she told reporters, and “began thrusting his genitals.” The two did go on to have dinner and discuss real estate, according to Zervos. When asked why she chose to come forward now, she said: “I want to be able to sleep when I’m 70.”\n\nTrump’s response: Nothing yet.\n\nWhen we found out: October 14, 2016\n\nWhen she says it happens: 2007\n \nKristin Anderson\n\nHer account: Anderson says she was out at a Manhattan nightclub with friends, sitting on a red velvet couch, when she felt Trump reach into her skirt and touch her vagina through her underwear, The Washington Post reports. She told the paper that the incident was brief, but that she and her friends were “very grossed out.” Anderson was in her early 20s at the time, and an aspiring model.\n\nTrump’s response: A spokeswoman for Trump told The Washington Post that he “denies this phony allegation by someone looking to get some free publicity. It is totally ridiculous.” It’s worth noting, though, that Anderson did not approach the Post with her story. She was contacted by a reporter who’d heard about her experience from other people, and reportedly deliberated for several days about whether or not to go public. \n\nWhen we found out: October 14, 2016\n\nWhen she says it happened: The early 1990s\n \nJessica Leeds\n\nHer account: More than 30 years ago, Leeds was traveling for work when she sat next to Trump on a flight to New York. Leeds, who is now 74, told The New York Times that she and Trump spoke for a bit, then about 45 minutes into the flight he lifted the armrest between them and began to grab her breasts and put his hand up her skirt. “He was like an octopus,” she told The New York Times. “His hands were everywhere.”\n\nTrump’s response: Trump vehemently denied the story. An attorney representing him has called upon The New York Times to retract it and has threatened to sue the publication. (The New York Times responded.)\n\nWhen we found out: October 12, 2016\n\nWhen she says it happened: The early 1980s\n\n \nRachel Crooks\n\nHer account: Crooks says she was assaulted by Trump in an elevator while working as a receptionist for a real estate investment and development company in Trump Tower. She told The New York Times that upon meeting Trump, she introduced herself and shook his hand, but he would not let go. Trump began to kiss her on the cheeks, then directly on the mouth. “It was so inappropriate,” she told the Times. “I was so upset that he thought I was so insignificant that he could do that.” Crooks was 22 at the time.\n\nTrump’s response: See above\n\nWhen we found out: October 12, 2016\n\nWhen she says it happened: 2005\n\n \nMindy McGillivray\n\nHer account: McGillivray, 36, told the Palm Beach Post that Trump groped her while she was attending a concert at Mar-a-Lago, his estate-slash-private-club in Palm Beach, Florida. She was there to help a friend who was photographing the concert, when she says Trump groped her. “All of a sudden I felt a grab, a little nudge. I think it’s Ken’s camera bag, that was my first instinct. I turn around and there’s Donald,” McGillivray told the Palm Beach Post. “This was a pretty good nudge. More of a grab,’’ she continued. “It was pretty close to the center of my butt. I was startled. I jumped.”\n\nTrump’s response: A day after the account was published, CNN reported that Trump’s campaign was drafting a lawsuit against the paper.\n\nWhen we found out: October 12, 2016\n\nWhen she says it happened: 2003\n\n \nNatasha Stoynoff\n\nHer account: In a harrowing essay for People, Stoynoff ― a journalist ― described how Trump assaulted her while she was interviewing him and his wife, Melania, at their Palm Beach estate. She writes that Trump insisted on giving her a private tour of the grounds, at which point he pinned and kissed her: “Trump shut the door behind us. I turned around, and within seconds, he was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat ... I was grateful when Trump’s longtime butler burst into the room a minute later, as I tried to unpin myself.”\n\nTrump’s response: At a campaign rally, Trump questioned her claims saying, “Look at her. ... I don’t think so.”\n\nWhen we found out: October 12, 2016\n\nWhen she says it happened: 2005\n\n \nJennifer Murphy\n\nHer account: Murphy, a contestant on season four of “The Apprentice,” told Grazia that Trump kissed her on the lips after a job interview. “He walked me to the elevator, and I said goodbye. ... When he pulled my face in and gave me a smooch. I was like ‘OK,’” she told Grazia. “I didn’t know how to act.” Murphy also told the publication that she still plans to vote for Trump.\n\nTrump’s response: N/A\n\nWhen we found out: October 12, 2016\n\nWhen she says it happened: 2005\n\n \nTemple Taggart McDowell\n\nHer account: The year that Taggart McDowell was crowned Miss Utah, Trump had just taken ownership of the Miss USA pageant. She says that when she was first introduced to him, he kissed her. “He kissed me directly on the lips,” Taggart McDowell told The New York Times when she came forward with her story. “I thought, ‘Oh my God, gross.’ He was married to Marla Maples at the time … I was like ‘Wow, that’s inappropriate.’”\n\nTrump’s response: Trump told NBC he doesn’t know who she is and denies he ever assaulted her. \n\nWhen we found out: May 2016\n\nWhen she says it happened: 1997\n\n \nCassandra Searles \n\nHer account: Yahoo News reports that over the summer, Cassandra Searles ― Miss Washington 2013 ― posted a photo on Facebook of her fellow contestants and the question: “Do y’all remember that one time we had to do our onstage introductions, but this one guy treated us like cattle and made us do it again because we didn’t look him in the eyes? Do you also remember when he then proceeded to have us lined up so he could get a closer look at his property?” In a follow-up comment on the post, she reportedly added: “He probably doesn’t want me telling the story about that time he continually grabbed my ass and invited me to his hotel room.”\n\nTrump’s response: N/A\n\nWhen we found out: June 2016\n\nWhen she says it happened: Not totally clear, but presumably in 2013\n\n \n“Jane Doe” \n\nHer account: In June, a California woman — “Jane Doe” ― filed a lawsuit alleging that Trump raped her at a party when she was 13 years old. As Buzzfeed reported, an initial hearing in the case has been scheduled for December 2016.\n\nTrump’s response: Trump has vigorously denied the claims, saying that the lawsuit was designed to smear his presidential campaign.\n\nWhen we found out: June 2016\n\nWhen she says it happened: 1994\n\n \nJill Harth\n\nHer account: Harth worked with Trump in the 1990s (she and her partner operated a competition called American Dream Calendar Girls), but it ended in a bitter legal battle. In a 1997 lawsuit, Harth alleged in court documents that Trump repeatedly sexually harassed her, at one point groping her under the table. (The documents were surfaced by The Boston Globe.) Though she eventually dropped that suit, she stands by her story. “How can people not believe me now?” she asked “Inside Edition” after footage of Trump saying he grabs women by the pussy emerged. \n\nTrump’s response: In a May New York Times article on Trump’s treatment of women that also included Harth’s account, Trump said it was, in fact, Harth who had pursued him. \n\nWhen we found out: April 2016\n\nWhen she says it happens: 1993\n\n \nIvana Trump\n\nHer account: In a 1992 deposition during their divorce, Trump’s first wife described an incident in which she says her then-husband forced her to have sex with him. (Spousal rape is still rape.) The deposition came to light in the 1993 Trump biography Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump. Ivana later softened her claims, saying that she “felt violated” as the love and tenderness she was accustomed to from her husband was absent that night, but she was not accusing him of a crime. She followed-up with a statement obtained by CNN last June telling in which she said “the story is totally without merit.”\n\nTrump’s response: He denies it ever took place. \n\nWhen we found out: 1993\n\nWhen she says it happens: 1989\n\n \n\nNeed help?

    "content": "<p>V&Eacute;LO - Il y a un petit nouveau chez Ikea et il sort du lot. Le g&eacute;ant de l'ameublement su&eacute;dois a sorti fin septembre son premier <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/news/velo/\" target=\"_blank\">v&eacute;lo</a>. La b&ecirc;te r&eacute;pond au doux nom de <a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/fr/fr/catalog/products/20326738/\" target=\"_blank\">Sladda </a>et la premi&egrave;re chose qui surprend, c'est son prix.</p>\n\n<p>499 euros pour les d&eacute;tenteurs de la carte Ikea Family, 750 euros pour les autres. Le v&eacute;lo est pens&eacute; pour les cyclistes urbains mais ceux qui s'attendaient &agrave; un v&eacute;lo low cost que l'on ne craint pas vraiment de se faire voler risquent de s'&eacute;touffer... On est loin de la table basse &agrave; moins de 10 euros!</p>\n\n<p>500 euros minimum pour un v&eacute;lo Ikea, quand il faut compter un peu plus de 200 euros chez Decathlon pour s'offrir un v&eacute;lo de ville? Lorsque Ikea a fait parvenir son premier v&eacute;lo &agrave; la r&eacute;daction du <em>HuffPost</em> pour un test, nous avons tout de suite cherch&eacute; &agrave; comprendre ce qui justifie un tel prix. Et on vous explique ce qu'on a trouv&eacute; <strong>dans la vid&eacute;o ci-dessus</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Un v&eacute;lo en kit</strong></p>\n\n<p>Surtout que Sladda -comme tout bon produit Ikea qui se respecte- est vendu en kit. Les pi&egrave;ces strat&eacute;giques sont d&eacute;j&agrave; mont&eacute;es, mais c'est &agrave; vous d'assembler la roue avant, le guidon, les p&eacute;dales, la selle et les garde-boue. Avant de sortir faire un tour, comptez 1h30 &agrave; 2 heures pour monter votre nouveau joujou.</p>\n\n<p>L'assemblage termin&eacute;, notre v&eacute;lo nous est apparu moins \"styl&eacute;\" que sur les photos promotionnelles qui vendaient un v&eacute;lo immacul&eacute; dont le design avait de quoi rendre jaloux les adorateurs de fixies. En r&eacute;alit&eacute;, Sladda n'a rien d'un v&eacute;lo de course. L&eacute;g&egrave;rement emp&acirc;t&eacute; et gris, il n'est pas loin de nous rappeler les bons vieux V&eacute;lib' de la capitale.</p>\n\n<p><strong>R&eacute;trop&eacute;dalage et courroie crant&eacute;e</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mais sur l'asphalte, on comprend un peu mieux ce qui fait sa force (et son prix).</p>\n\n<p>Sladda n'a qu'un frein apparent &agrave; l'avant (&agrave; disque, c'est assez rare pour le pr&eacute;ciser). &Agrave; l'arri&egrave;re, il faut r&eacute;trop&eacute;daler pour freiner. Une m&eacute;thode en vogue, <a href=\"http://www.lexpress.fr/tendances/soin-homme/velo-pedalez-branche-avec-le-fixie_1255509.html\">ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne fixie</a> oblige.</p>\n\n<p>En bloquant vos p&eacute;dales, vous stoppez la roue arri&egrave;re. Vous pouvez m&ecirc;me d&eacute;raper comme le font certains sur leurs fixies en bloquant la cha&icirc;ne. Apr&egrave;s quelques &agrave;-coups sur les premiers kilom&egrave;tres, on s'habitue vite.</p>\n\n<p>D'ailleurs, en parlant de cha&icirc;ne, Sladda n'en a pas. Ceux qui sont d&eacute;j&agrave; arriv&eacute;s au bureau les mains pleines de cambouis seront heureux de voir que la vieille cha&icirc;ne rouill&eacute;e a c&eacute;d&eacute; sa place &agrave; une transmission par courroie crant&eacute;e en plastique. Il parait qu'un cycliste a r&eacute;ussi &agrave; faire un tour du monde complet sans en changer mais Ikea nous informe qu'elle est tout de m&ecirc;me garantie 10 ans.</p>\n\n<p>\"J'aurais peur qu'on la coupe d'un coup de cutter\", s'est inqui&eacute;t&eacute; un coll&egrave;gue qui semble avoir des ennemis en nous croisant dans le garage &agrave; v&eacute;lo. Mais il est bien le seul \"v&eacute;lotafeur\" &agrave; ne pas convoiter la fameuse courroie que l'on a plut&ocirc;t l'habitude de voir sur des v&eacute;los haut de gamme &agrave; plus de 1000 euros.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Deux vitesses int&eacute;gr&eacute;es</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ceux qui fantasment sur ce bout de plastique savent qu'une courroie n'est pas compatible avec un d&eacute;railleur... Il n'y a donc pas de vitesses sur le v&eacute;lo Ikea? Si, mais elles sont automatiques et int&eacute;gr&eacute;es au moyeu arri&egrave;re. En langage petite-roulette cela veut dire que les vitesses se passent toutes seules en fonction de l'effort que vous fournissez sur les p&eacute;dales.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pas de c&acirc;ble qui rouille ou qui casse... En revanche, gare aux mont&eacute;es! Les vitesses se passent avec fluidit&eacute; mais les rapports ne semblent pas calcul&eacute;s pour les grandes pentes. Les Parisiens comprendront donc notre peine &agrave; arriver en haut de la rue M&eacute;nilmontant. Sladda et les d&eacute;nivel&eacute;s, oubliez.</p>\n\n<p>L'autre petit d&eacute;faut de Sladda c'est sans doute son poids. On est loin des 22 kilos d'un V&eacute;lib', mais Sladda atteint les 16 kilos malgr&eacute; un cadre en aluminium. Les vieux v&eacute;los de ville dont raffolent les urbains p&egrave;sent g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement entre 8 et 12 kilos. Et quelques kilos en plus ne passent pas inaper&ccedil;us quand on porte son destrier dans les escaliers.</p>\n\n<p>Apr&egrave;s une semaine et une centaine de kilom&egrave;tres sur la selle de Sladda (tr&egrave;s confortable au passage), on lui trouve des d&eacute;fauts mais on s'est aussi habitu&eacute; &agrave; frimer en freinant et au confort de ne plus avoir &agrave; passer les vitesses...</p>\n\n<p>Ikea semble conscient que Sladda est un pari risqu&eacute;. Pour son premier v&eacute;lo, le g&eacute;ant bleu et jaune n'a pas inond&eacute; ses magasins. Le v&eacute;lo a &eacute;t&eacute; produit en petite quantit&eacute;, de nombreux magasins fran&ccedil;ais n'ont pas encore &eacute;t&eacute; livr&eacute;s et la com' reste discr&egrave;te. Ikea a toutefois pens&eacute; &agrave; tous les \"accessoires\". Porte-bagages, remorque, antivol, casque et pompe &agrave; v&eacute;lo... Si Sladda perce chez les cyclistes des villes, ils auront plus utile &agrave; ramener qu'une tarte au Daim en passant en caisse.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lire aussi :</strong></p>\n\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/07/31/video-velo-conseils-securite-vol_n_11236342.html\" target=\"_hplink\">Vous voulez vous mettre au v&eacute;lo?

    "plain_text": "\nVÉLO - Il y a un petit nouveau chez Ikea et il sort du lot. Le géant de l'ameublement suédois a sorti fin septembre son premier vélo. La bête répond au doux nom de Sladda et la première chose qui surprend, c'est son prix.\n\n\n499 euros pour les détenteurs de la carte Ikea Family, 750 euros pour les autres. Le vélo est pensé pour les cyclistes urbains mais ceux qui s'attendaient à un vélo low cost que l'on ne craint pas vraiment de se faire voler risquent de s'étouffer... On est loin de la table basse à moins de 10 euros!\n\n\n500 euros minimum pour un vélo Ikea, quand il faut compter un peu plus de 200 euros chez Decathlon pour s'offrir un vélo de ville? Lorsque Ikea a fait parvenir son premier vélo à la rédaction du HuffPost pour un test, nous avons tout de suite cherché à comprendre ce qui justifie un tel prix. Et on vous explique ce qu'on a trouvé dans la vidéo ci-dessus.\n\n\nUn vélo en kit\n\n\nSurtout que Sladda -comme tout bon produit Ikea qui se respecte- est vendu en kit. Les pièces stratégiques sont déjà montées, mais c'est à vous d'assembler la roue avant, le guidon, les pédales, la selle et les garde-boue. Avant de sortir faire un tour, comptez 1h30 à 2 heures pour monter votre nouveau joujou.\n\n\nL'assemblage terminé, notre vélo nous est apparu moins \"stylé\" que sur les photos promotionnelles qui vendaient un vélo immaculé dont le design avait de quoi rendre jaloux les adorateurs de fixies. En réalité, Sladda n'a rien d'un vélo de course. Légèrement empâté et gris, il n'est pas loin de nous rappeler les bons vieux Vélib' de la capitale.\n\n\nRétropédalage et courroie crantée\n\n\nMais sur l'asphalte, on comprend un peu mieux ce qui fait sa force (et son prix).\n\n\nSladda n'a qu'un frein apparent à l'avant (à disque, c'est assez rare pour le préciser). À l'arrière, il faut rétropédaler pour freiner. Une méthode en vogue, phénomène fixie oblige.\n\n\nEn bloquant vos pédales, vous stoppez la roue arrière. Vous pouvez même déraper comme le font certains sur leurs fixies en bloquant la chaîne. Après quelques à-coups sur les premiers kilomètres, on s'habitue vite.\n\n\nD'ailleurs, en parlant de chaîne, Sladda n'en a pas. Ceux qui sont déjà arrivés au bureau les mains pleines de cambouis seront heureux de voir que la vieille chaîne rouillée a cédé sa place à une transmission par courroie crantée en plastique. Il parait qu'un cycliste a réussi à faire un tour du monde complet sans en changer mais Ikea nous informe qu'elle est tout de même garantie 10 ans.\n\n\n\"J'aurais peur qu'on la coupe d'un coup de cutter\", s'est inquiété un collègue qui semble avoir des ennemis en nous croisant dans le garage à vélo. Mais il est bien le seul \"vélotafeur\" à ne pas convoiter la fameuse courroie que l'on a plutôt l'habitude de voir sur des vélos haut de gamme à plus de 1000 euros.\n\n\nDeux vitesses intégrées\n\n\nCeux qui fantasment sur ce bout de plastique savent qu'une courroie n'est pas compatible avec un dérailleur... Il n'y a donc pas de vitesses sur le vélo Ikea? Si, mais elles sont automatiques et intégrées au moyeu arrière. En langage petite-roulette cela veut dire que les vitesses se passent toutes seules en fonction de l'effort que vous fournissez sur les pédales.\n\n\nPas de câble qui rouille ou qui casse... En revanche, gare aux montées! Les vitesses se passent avec fluidité mais les rapports ne semblent pas calculés pour les grandes pentes. Les Parisiens comprendront donc notre peine à arriver en haut de la rue Ménilmontant. Sladda et les dénivelés, oubliez.\n\n\nL'autre petit défaut de Sladda c'est sans doute son poids. On est loin des 22 kilos d'un Vélib', mais Sladda atteint les 16 kilos malgré un cadre en aluminium. Les vieux vélos de ville dont raffolent les urbains pèsent généralement entre 8 et 12 kilos. Et quelques kilos en plus ne passent pas inaperçus quand on porte son destrier dans les escaliers.\n\n\nAprès une semaine et une centaine de kilomètres sur la selle de Sladda (très confortable au passage), on lui trouve des défauts mais on s'est aussi habitué à frimer en freinant et au confort de ne plus avoir à passer les vitesses...\n\n\nIkea semble conscient que Sladda est un pari risqué. Pour son premier vélo, le géant bleu et jaune n'a pas inondé ses magasins. Le vélo a été produit en petite quantité, de nombreux magasins français n'ont pas encore été livrés et la com' reste discrète. Ikea a toutefois pensé à tous les \"accessoires\". Porte-bagages, remorque, antivol, casque et pompe à vélo... Si Sladda perce chez les cyclistes des villes, ils auront plus utile à ramener qu'une tarte au Daim en passant en caisse.\n\n\n\nLire aussi :\n\n\n• Vous voulez vous mettre au vélo?

L'immeuble était récent selon la même source, qui indique qu'il aurait été construit dans les années 2000.\n\n\n\n\n#Angers Photos #franceinfo de l'immeuble où l'effondrement d'un balcon lors d'une pendaison de crémaillère a fait quatre morts et 14 blessés pic.twitter.com/v9yD4A66Jj\n— franceinfo (@franceinfo) 16 octobre 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n#Angers Photo de l'arrière du bâtiment, où l'effondrement d'un balcon a fait quatre morts et 14 blessés, via @AFPphoto pic.twitter.com/ubErVtexm0\n— franceinfo (@franceinfo) 16 octobre 2016\n\n\n\n\"La cause de cet accident dramatique est de toute évidence accidentelle\", a jugé une source proche de l'enquête. Aucun des blessés n'est par ailleurs en danger de vie ou de mort, a-t-on précisé de source hospitalière. Le balcon s'est écroulé pour une cause inconnue, entraînant les balcons des deux étages inférieurs. Mais selon une source de l'enquête, personne ne se trouvait sur ces balcons inférieurs.\n\n\n\nUn important dispositif de sécurité a été déployé autour du bâtiment, situé dans le centre-ville de la préfecture du Maine-et-Loire. Plusieurs dizaines de pompiers sont intervenus. Dans la matinée de dimanche, l'essentiel du déblaiement des gravats a été effectué et les quatre corps ont été retrouvés. On indiquait auprès des secours qu'on ne cherchait plus d'autres victimes.\n\n\n\nL'immeuble a été évacué, mais ses habitants ont été autorisés dans la matinée à aller y rechercher des affaires personnelles. Des experts étaient à l'oeuvre dans l'appartement du troisième étage pour effectuer des relevés, en particulier sur les scellements des balcons dans la façade. De source proche de l'enquête, une information judiciaire devrait être rapidement ouverte pour établir les circonstances du drame.\n\n\nLes victimes sont âgées d'une vingtaine d'années\n\n\n\nLes quatre personnes tuées sont trois hommes de 21, 23 et 25 ans et une jeune fille de 18 ans, selon une source proche de l'enquête. Sept hommes et sept femmes, âgés d'entre 18 et 27 ans, ont été blessées. Quatre sont \"grièvement atteints\", les dix autres \"plus légèrement\" blessés. \"Beaucoup d'autres (qui participaient à cette fête) sont choquées psychologiquement\", a indiqué la même source.\n\n\nDix personnes, dont une en urgence absolue sans que le pronostic vital soit engagé, ont été évacuées vers le CHU d'Angers. Selon une porte-parole du CHU interrogée par l'AFP, outre les dix blessés transportés dans ce centre hospitalier, quatre autres l'ont été à la clinique de l'Anjou.\n\n\nSelon Francis Wetta, directeur départemental de la sécurité publique (DDSP), six personnes sur quatorze ont déjà quitté les deux hôpitaux où ils avaient été conduits après l'accident. \n\n\nD'importants moyens de secours ont été déployés. 70 hommes sapeurs-pompiers ont été mobilisés avec notamment la cellule sauvetage déblaiement de Saumur, ainsi que le SAMU. La Cellule d'urgence médico-psychologique (CUMP) a été déclenchée pour les victimes très choquées. La Croix Rouge est également mobilisée auprès des familles. Un centre de soutien aux familles est organisé à l'accueil du CHU.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n#DrameAngers Les familles peuvent appeler le @chu_angers au 02 41 35 37 21 ou se présenter au bât. Larrey @Angers https://t.co/aVchMqn6x7\n— CHU Angers (@chu_angers) 16 octobre 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUn accident qui reste rare, malgré quelques précédents\n\n\nCe n'est pas le premier accident de ce type en France, mais les précédents n'avaient pas fait autant de victimes. En juillet 2013, une octogénaire était morte mercredi dans l'effondrement du balcon d'un chalet à Mandray dans les Vosges lors d'une réunion de famille, tandis que trois autres personnes avaient été blessées.\n\n\nEn Ile-de-France, en 2007, plusieurs balcons d'un immeuble d'Issy-les-Moulineaux dans les Hauts-de-Seine s'étaient effondrés sans faire de blessés. La même année, deux femmes avaient été grièvement touchées après avoir été entraînées dans la chute du balcon sur lequel elles se trouvaient, au deuxième étage d'un immeuble de Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois  en Essonne.\n\n\nA l'étranger, notamment aux Etats-Unis, plusieurs drames similaires ont eu lieu: l'un a coûté la vie à six étudiants irlandais, en 2015 à Berkeley en Californie, un autre avait fait 13 morts et 57 autres blessés en 2003 à Chicago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLire aussi :\n\n\n• Pour suivre les dernières actualités en direct sur Le HuffPost, cliquez ici\n\n\n• Tous les matins, recevez gratuitement la newsletter du HuffPost\n\n\n• Retrouvez-nous sur notre page Facebook\n\n\n\nÀ voir également sur Le HuffPost:\n\n\n\n ",

Vous ne l'entendrez jamais parler de parti pour se d&eacute;finir. Et pour cause.

Nous ne sommes pas l&agrave; pour faire gagner tel ou tel candidat mais nos id&eacute;es.

Juridiquement pourtant, depuis 2014, LMPT est pass&eacute;e du statut d'association &agrave; but non lucratif &agrave; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2015/04/24/la-manif-pour-tous-devient-un-parti-politique-mais-pas-pour-pre/?utm_hp_ref=fr-manif-pour-tous\" target=\"_blank\">celui de groupement politique</a> (mais sans adh&eacute;rents), ce qui offre aux donateurs une r&eacute;duction fiscale. Il s'agissait alors de se mettre en conformit&eacute; avec l'action r&eacute;ellement politique du mouvement. \"Techniquement, nous sommes en capacit&eacute; de pr&eacute;senter des candidats mais nous ne le ferons pas\", pr&eacute;cise-t-il.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Convergence sur la famille, divergence sur le reste</strong><br />\n<br />\nFin 2013, pourtant, les responsables du parti sont &agrave; deux doigts de franchir le pas et de se lancer. Port&eacute;e par des manifestations qui attirent une foule consid&eacute;rable, LMPT s'interroge: pour faire gagner ses id&eacute;es, avoir des &eacute;lus qui les portent est indispensable mais la classe politique actuelle est-elle en capacit&eacute; de le faire? \"N'a-t-on pas int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &agrave; y aller nous-m&ecirc;mes?\", se demandent alors les dirigeants. Pour les europ&eacute;ennes de 2014, tout est pr&ecirc;t. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2014/01/15/la-manif-pour-tous-elections_n_4602324.html\" target=\"_blank\">\"On a plus qu'&agrave; appuyer sur le bouton\"</a>, confie alors un responsable.

On ne peut pas se pr&eacute;senter avec pour seules propositions des id&eacute;es sur la famille\", r&eacute;pond aujourd'hui Alb&eacute;ric Dumont.<br />\n<br />\nEt pour cause, si les revendications de LMPT ont &eacute;volu&eacute; au fil du temps (du mariage pour les couples gay &agrave; la th&eacute;orie du genre en passant par la PMA et la GPA), jamais ou presque elles ne se sont &eacute;loign&eacute;es de la cause familiale et de l'enfance. \"Notre seul combat, c'est l'enfant et la famille\", r&eacute;p&egrave;te en boucle Ludovine de la Roch&egrave;re. Tout juste a-t-il &eacute;t&eacute; question parfois de fiscalit&eacute; quand il fallait d&eacute;fendre (en vain) l'universalit&eacute; des allocations familiales. \"Au sein du mouvement, nous avons des id&eacute;es communes sur la famille mais bien des divergences sur tous les autres sujets, justifie Alb&eacute;ric Dumont. A titre personnel, on a nos id&eacute;es mais nous n'avons pas la l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; collective pour parler pouvoir d'achat, relations internationales ou s&eacute;curit&eacute;.\" Impossible dans ces conditions de construire un programme commun plus &eacute;labor&eacute;.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Influer de l'ext&eacute;rieur, tel un lobby</strong><br />\n<br />\nDepuis le d&eacute;but, LMPT pr&eacute;f&egrave;re la strat&eacute;gie du lobbying. Le terme n'est pas assum&eacute; en interne car on r&eacute;cuse l'id&eacute;e que le mouvement chercherait &agrave; servir des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts particuliers mais la logique est bien celle-ci: influer de l'ext&eacute;rieur sur les d&eacute;cisions prises par les dirigeants politiques. \"D&egrave;s 2013, nous avons encourag&eacute; les bonnes volont&eacute;s &agrave; rejoindre les partis car nous avons identifi&eacute; une soif d'engagement chez les manifestants. Nous voulions que nos id&eacute;es sur la famille soient repr&eacute;sent&eacute;es. C'est comme cela qu'est n&eacute; Sens commun au sein des R&eacute;publicains\", reprend Alb&eacute;ric Dumont.<br />\n<br />\nPartie prenante du parti de la droite, ce mouvement a fait parler de lui pendant la campagne de 2014 pour la pr&eacute;sidence de l'UMP quand <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2014/11/16/comment-nicolas-sarkozy-a-cede-aux-anti-mariage-gay-tout-en-res/?utm_hp_ref=fr-manif-pour-tous\" target=\"_blank\">Nicolas Sarkozy est venu dire devant ses membres</a> qu'il abrogerait la loi Taubira, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/01/22/pour-la-manif-pour-tous-nicolas-sarkozy-a-congedie-ses-convict/?utm_hp_ref=fr-manif-pour-tous\" target=\"_blank\">avant de finalement faire marche arri&egrave;re</a> quelques semaines plus tard.</p>\n<br />\n <iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"355\" hspace=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.ultimedia.com/deliver/generic/iframe/mdtk/01590560/zone/1/showtitle/1/src/uvr00z\" style=\"z-index:1;\" vspace=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"630\"></iframe><br />\n<br />\n \n<p>\"Nous ne sommes pas le bras politique arm&eacute; de LMPT, se d&eacute;fend Christophe Billan, le pr&eacute;sident de Sens Commun. Si nous avons particip&eacute; aux d&eacute;fil&eacute;s de LMPT, nous avons consid&eacute;r&eacute; &agrave; un moment qu'il fallait franchir le cap pour assumer le terme politique et ne pas tomber dans une esp&egrave;ce de fatalit&eacute;. C'est pourquoi nous avons eu des candidats aux &eacute;lections et <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2014/12/12/madeleine-bazin-de-jessey-la-leader-de-sens-commun-nommee-par-n/?utm_hp_ref=fr-manif-pour-tous\" target=\"_blank\">des responsabilit&eacute;s dans le parti</a>.\" Quand LMPT veut peser uniquement sur les choix li&eacute;s &agrave; la famille, Sens commun a d&eacute;clin&eacute; ses valeurs sur d'autres sujets, de la s&eacute;curit&eacute; &agrave; l'international.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Vers un Tea party &agrave; la fran&ccedil;aise?</strong><br />\n<br />\nPour 2017, et en commen&ccedil;ant par la primaire de droite, Sens commun a fait un choix clair: <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/09/01/francois-fillon-sens-commun-anti-mariage-gay-republicains_n_11811374.html\" target=\"_blank\">celui de soutenir Fran&ccedil;ois Fillon</a>. LMPT ne prendra pas position. \"Nous assumons d'<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2015/02/26/la-manif-pour-tous-veut-simpliquer-dans-les-departementales-apr/?utm_hp_ref=fr-manif-pour-tous\" target=\"_blank\">informer les &eacute;lecteurs sur ce que pensent les candidats</a> mais n'avons pas de l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; pour donner des consignes de vote\", indique Alb&eacute;ric Dumont qui d&eacute;fend le caract&egrave;re \"transpartisan\" du collectif. Transpartisan oui, avec cependant une inclinaison tr&egrave;s sensible vers la droite. \"Nous invitons tous les &eacute;lus &agrave; nous rejoindre, y compris ceux de gauche mais c'est vrai que nous touchons de l'UDI jusqu'au Front national\", ajoute-t-il.<br />\n<br />\nC'est ainsi que dans les cort&egrave;ges, on peut voir des &eacute;lus Les R&eacute;publicains (Herv&eacute; Mariton, Bruno Retailleau, Henri Guaino, Laurent Wauquiez), Parti chr&eacute;tien d&eacute;mocrate (Jean-Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Poisson), Debout La France (Nicolas Dupont-Aignan) et Front national (Marion Mar&eacute;chal-Le Pen, Gilbert Collard).<br />\n<br />\nCe penchant pour la droite de la droite pourrait accr&eacute;diter l'id&eacute;e que LMPT ou Sens commun seraient une d&eacute;clinaison fran&ccedil;aise du Tea party am&eacute;ricain r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; au grand jour par Sarah Palin en 2008. \"Le Tea party est rattach&eacute; au parti r&eacute;publicain, ce n'est pas notre cas\", &eacute;lude-t-on &agrave; LMPT. A Sens commun, on apporte une r&eacute;ponse plus politique. \"Chez nous, personne n'est conservateur au sens o&ugrave; on nous voulons geler le mod&egrave;le. Nous prenons acte du fait que la soci&eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;volue, il n'est pas question de figer la marche du monde comme ils le veulent\", se d&eacute;fend Christophe Billan.<br />\n<br />\nCet argument est peut-&ecirc;tre valable sur le plan &eacute;conomique puisqu'en soutenant Fran&ccedil;ois Fillon, Sens commun a opt&eacute; pour le candidat le plus lib&eacute;ral. Sur le th&egrave;me initial des revendications en revanche, ni Sens commun ni LMPT ne veut aller vers l'ouverture. Leur d&eacute;finition de la famille reste un papa, une maman, des enfants. Il y a plus progressiste comme mani&egrave;re de voir les choses.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lire aussi :</strong></p>\n\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/10/13/genevieve-de-fontenay-rejoint-la-manif-pour-tous/?utm_hp_ref=fr-manif-pour-tous\">Genevi&egrave;ve de Fontenay rejoint La Manif pour tous</a></p>\n\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/09/13/hetero-et-en-concubinage-la-manif-pour-tous-a-decide-de-vous-ma/?utm_hp_ref=fr-manif-pour-tous\">H&eacute;t&eacute;ro et en concubinage?

C'est comme cela qu'est né Sens commun au sein des Républicains\", reprend Albéric Dumont.\n\n\n\nPartie prenante du parti de la droite, ce mouvement a fait parler de lui pendant la campagne de 2014 pour la présidence de l'UMP quand Nicolas Sarkozy est venu dire devant ses membres qu'il abrogerait la loi Taubira, avant de finalement faire marche arrière quelques semaines plus tard.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\"Nous ne sommes pas le bras politique armé de LMPT, se défend Christophe Billan, le président de Sens Commun. Si nous avons participé aux défilés de LMPT, nous avons considéré à un moment qu'il fallait franchir le cap pour assumer le terme politique et ne pas tomber dans une espèce de fatalité. C'est pourquoi nous avons eu des candidats aux élections et des responsabilités dans le parti.\" Quand LMPT veut peser uniquement sur les choix liés à la famille, Sens commun a décliné ses valeurs sur d'autres sujets, de la sécurité à l'international.\n\n\n\nVers un Tea party à la française?\n\n\n\nPour 2017, et en commençant par la primaire de droite, Sens commun a fait un choix clair: celui de soutenir François Fillon. LMPT ne prendra pas position. \"Nous assumons d'informer les électeurs sur ce que pensent les candidats mais n'avons pas de légitimité pour donner des consignes de vote\", indique Albéric Dumont qui défend le caractère \"transpartisan\" du collectif. Transpartisan oui, avec cependant une inclinaison très sensible vers la droite. \"Nous invitons tous les élus à nous rejoindre, y compris ceux de gauche mais c'est vrai que nous touchons de l'UDI jusqu'au Front national\", ajoute-t-il.\n\n\n\nC'est ainsi que dans les cortèges, on peut voir des élus Les Républicains (Hervé Mariton, Bruno Retailleau, Henri Guaino, Laurent Wauquiez), Parti chrétien démocrate (Jean-Frédéric Poisson), Debout La France (Nicolas Dupont-Aignan) et Front national (Marion Maréchal-Le Pen, Gilbert Collard).\n\n\n\nCe penchant pour la droite de la droite pourrait accréditer l'idée que LMPT ou Sens commun seraient une déclinaison française du Tea party américain révélé au grand jour par Sarah Palin en 2008. \"Le Tea party est rattaché au parti républicain, ce n'est pas notre cas\", élude-t-on à LMPT. A Sens commun, on apporte une réponse plus politique. \"Chez nous, personne n'est conservateur au sens où on nous voulons geler le modèle. Nous prenons acte du fait que la société évolue, il n'est pas question de figer la marche du monde comme ils le veulent\", se défend Christophe Billan.\n\n\n\nCet argument est peut-être valable sur le plan économique puisqu'en soutenant François Fillon, Sens commun a opté pour le candidat le plus libéral. Sur le thème initial des revendications en revanche, ni Sens commun ni LMPT ne veut aller vers l'ouverture. Leur définition de la famille reste un papa, une maman, des enfants. Il y a plus progressiste comme manière de voir les choses.\n\n\n\nLire aussi :\n\n\n• Geneviève de Fontenay rejoint La Manif pour tous\n\n\n• Hétéro et en concubinage?

L'entreprise a répondu dans un communiqué de presse ce vendredi 14 octobre, pour \"mettre les points sur les cookies\". Ce texte commence par un démenti: \"Sommes-nous homophobes? Non\" et se termine sur ce message: \"Notre conviction c'est que cookie après cookie, l'oiseau fait son nid. Que nous pouvons tous changer le monde, chacun à notre façon.\"\n\n\nTout au long de ces 26 lignes, Michel et Augustin s'attachent à répondre au principal argument avancé par leur détracteurs, à savoir leur proximité - directe ou indirecte - avec les milieux conservateurs et notamment La Manif pour tous.\n\n\n\nUne proximité avec François Fillon...\n\n\nLe premier point que soulèvent les détracteurs de la marque est la proximité de ses fondateurs avec François Fillon, candidat à la primaire de la droite et du centre - et soutien assumé de la Manif pour tous. En mars 2016, Augustin Paluel-Marmont, un des deux papas de l'enseigne expliquait, après sa rencontre avec l'ancien Premier ministre: \"Je pense que Fillon c'est le seul qui a vraiment bossé sur le fond (...) je pense que le mec est bon pour relancer la France\", comme en atteste la vidéo ci-dessous, publiée par le compte Twitter des \"Jeunes avec Fillon\".\n\n\nSelon l'équipe de campagne du candidat, le fondateur de la marque aurait également déclaré, quelques semaines plus tard: \"François Fillon est le seul homme politique à formuler un horizon politique pour la France\".\n\n\n\n\n\"@FrancoisFillon est le seul qui a vraiment bossé le fond.\" - Augustin, de @Michel_Augustin #FF2017              pic.twitter.com/tom49aLssH\n— Jeunes avec Fillon (@JeunesFillon) 21 mars 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.@Michel_Augustin : \"@FrancoisFillon est le seul homme politique à formuler un horizon politique pour la France.\" pic.twitter.com/erc6Ogk3AB\n— FILLON 2017 (@Fillon2017_fr) 30 mai 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA ces déclarations, s'ajoute une rencontre avec le candidat lors d'un conférence organisée par la marque. Dans son communiqué, \"Michel &Augustin\" précise que cette rencontre a eu lieu dans le cadre de \"Boire une vache avec\", un cycle de conférences, arguant qu'ils ont également rencontré Nicolas Sarkozy, Ségolène Royal ou Fleur Pellerin.\n\n\n\"Y a-t-il un lien avec l'homophobie. Non\", souligne l'entreprise dans son communiqué. Effectivement, difficile de voir un lien entre proximité au candidat Fillon et homophobie supposée de la marque, mais c'est apparemment un pas que certains n'hésitent pas à franchir.\n\n\n\n... et des milieux conservateurs\n\n\n\nMais il n'y a pas que cette proximité avec François Fillon qui est pointée du doigt. Le soutien qu'apporte Michel & Augustin à la start-up Gens de confiance, une entreprise dont un des fondateurs, Nicolas Davoust, serait proche de la Manif pour tous, est aussi décrié, comme l'explique le tweet d'une journaliste de Libération ci-dessous.\n\n\n\n\nLes charmants amis de @Michel_Augustin. Merci @peultier pour la veille. pic.twitter.com/3C1D7553sF\n— Camille Gévaudan (@khomille) 12 octobre 2016\n\n\n\nDans leur communiqué, les \"trublions du goût\", se défendent en expliquant qu'ils ont \"la joie de recevoir chaque année des centaines de demandes de coups de pouce, de partenariats, de sponsorings, d'informations pour des mémoires d'étudiants, de conférences...\" et qu'un de leurs \"trublions\" a \"pris l'initiative d'offrir quelques-unes de [leurs] recettes à l'occasion d'une soirée organisée au profit de l'association Lazare par la start-up 'Gens de confiance'\".\n\n\nCes explications ont-elles convaincu? Pas du tout. Au contraire, des internautes se sont appuyés sur \"les initiatives\" soutenues par la marque pour formuler de nouvelles accusations, à savoir le fait d'être contre l'avortement. Il se trouve que dans les initiatives que défendent les deux fondateurs, figure l'association \"La différence est une chance\", créée par Augustin Paluel-Marmont lui-même, en faveur des personnes touchées par la trisomie 21.\n\n\nOr, selon des captures d'écran du site de l'association - qui a depuis disparu d'internet - \"La différence est une chance\" met en avant, dans les \"liens utiles\", des ouvrages de la Fondations Lejeune. Une organisation anti-IVG qui avait fait polémique il y a quelques semaines en éditant des brochures anti-avortement dans des lycées privés.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDans les infos pratiques https://t.co/0NcRaJStAp au rayon des bouquins conseillés on trouve ceux de la Fondation Lejeune @Michel_Augustin pic.twitter.com/K3r4j4d3uS\n— Norden Gail (@Nordengail) 15 octobre 2016\n\n\n\n\n\nDans les \"liens utiles\" de l'association que vous soutenez, la Fondation Lejeune encore https://t.co/MtIhGIxeAP @Michel_Augustin\n— Norden Gail (@Nordengail) 15 octobre 2016\n\n\n\n\n\nSi certains internautes ont appelé au boycott des célèbres biscuits, reste à savoir si le mouvement prendra de l'ampleur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLire aussi :\n\n\n• Le géant de l'alimentaire Danone met un pied chez Michel & Augustin \n\n\n• Le discours émouvant du DG de Danone aux diplômés d'HEC\n\n\n• Fillon affiche sa \"sympathie\" et son \"soutien\" à la Manif pour tous\n\n\n• Pour suivre les dernières actualités en direct sur Le HuffPost, cliquez ici\n\n\n• Tous les matins, recevez gratuitement la newsletter du HuffPost\n\n\n• Retrouvez-nous sur notre page Facebook\n\n\n\nÀ voir également sur Le HuffPost:\n\n\n\n\n ",

Elle tente de retenir un mouvement inexorable, celui de l'inclusion des personnes LGBT et de la lutte contre le sexisme, en surfant sur la crainte d'une dilution des valeurs, que les d&eacute;bats sur la la&iuml;cit&eacute; ou l'islam contribuent &agrave; alimenter.</p>\n\n<div>\n<p><strong>La manif pour tous... contre tou.te.s</strong></p>\n\n<p>Les premiers coups contre une soci&eacute;t&eacute; plus inclusive sont venus de la campagne politico-religieuse contre le programme d'&eacute;ducation &agrave; l'&eacute;galit&eacute; filles-gar&ccedil;ons au sein de l'Education nationale, nomm&eacute; \"ABCD de l'&eacute;galit&eacute;\". L'argument principal &eacute;tait que le genre serait une id&eacute;ologie politique f&eacute;ministe sans fondement scientifique qui remettrait en cause les raisons naturelles et symboliques de ladite diff&eacute;rence des sexes et de la n&eacute;cessaire distinction entre le f&eacute;minin et le masculin. Les d&eacute;tracteurs du genre et leurs attaques contre l'&eacute;cole r&eacute;publicaine ont ainsi sem&eacute; le trouble aupr&egrave;s des parents et entra&icirc;n&eacute; un tel malaise que les &eacute;quipes &eacute;ducatives se sont retrouv&eacute;es d&eacute;munies alors m&ecirc;me que l'Education Nationale s'engageait &agrave; mettre l'accent sur la formation critique des enfants aux st&eacute;r&eacute;otypes et &agrave; leurs cons&eacute;quences sociales. Il faut en effet rappeler ici avec force que le genre n'est pas le mythe qu'il est accus&eacute; d'&ecirc;tre. Le genre est un concept utilis&eacute; et v&eacute;rifi&eacute; de mani&egrave;re th&eacute;orique et empirique depuis les ann&eacute;es 1970. Ces travaux pointent les effets in&eacute;galitaires et les violences physiques et symboliques relatives au genre dans les diff&eacute;rentes institutions, notamment au sein de l'&eacute;cole : apr&egrave;s l'apparence physique, l'identit&eacute; de genre et l'orientation sexuelle r&eacute;elle ou suppos&eacute;e est la deuxi&egrave;me cause de violence &agrave; l'&eacute;cole et concerne les gar&ccedil;ons trop eff&eacute;min&eacute;s (les \"p&eacute;d&eacute;s\") et certaines filles (les \"putes\" et \"les salopes\" ), victimes de harc&egrave;lement physique ou sur les r&eacute;seaux sociaux.</p>\n\n<p>De m&ecirc;me, tout comme les enfants de divorc&eacute;s ont longtemps &eacute;t&eacute; stigmatis&eacute;s, c'est l'ensemble des &eacute;l&egrave;ves vivant dans des nouvelles formes de famille (notamment homo ou transparentales) qui risquent de l'&ecirc;tre si certaines familles imposent comme seule d&eacute;finition de la famille \"normale\", \"naturelle\", \"traditionnelle\", la famille nucl&eacute;aire dont on sait qu'elle n'a jamais prot&eacute;g&eacute; aucun enfant de maltraitances psychique et physique.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Extension du domaine de la lutte</strong></p>\n\n<p>Si, jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent, La Manif Pour Tous avait cibl&eacute; ses attaques contre la \"th&eacute;orie du genre\", la communaut&eacute; LGBT et le f&eacute;minisme, les r&eacute;cents propos du Pape et les soutiens engrang&eacute;s du c&ocirc;t&eacute; de candidats r&eacute;publicains (comme Fran&ccedil;ois Fillon) redimensionnent fortement La Manif Pour Tous, ainsi transform&eacute;e en parti politique. Pourtant, ces combats sont d'ores et d&eacute;j&agrave; perdus: le mariage pour tous est largement accept&eacute; par les Fran&ccedil;ais.es; depuis jeudi la France s'est dot&eacute;e d'une loi permettant aux personnes trans de changer leur &eacute;tat civil dans le cadre de proc&eacute;dures facilit&eacute;es etc...</p>\n\n<p>La particularit&eacute; de la manifestation de ce dimanche est, pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment, qu'elle intervient dans un contexte de tension autour du concept de la la&iuml;cit&eacute;. Autrement dit, il ne s'agit plus d'appr&eacute;hender La Manif Pour Tous comme un mouvement circonscrit autour d'une opposition aux questions de genre et de sexualit&eacute;. D'ores et d&eacute;j&agrave;, La Manif Pour Tous, dans ses soutiens politiques notamment, augure d'un &eacute;talement du rejet du c&ocirc;t&eacute; de l'alt&eacute;rit&eacute; en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, de l'alt&eacute;rit&eacute; raciale et religieuse en particulier. Nul doute que la suspicion et la volont&eacute; correctrice, normalisante, de La Manif Pour Tous &agrave; l'&eacute;gard des LGBT notamment, trouve un &eacute;cho direct du c&ocirc;t&eacute; des promesses d'assimilation forc&eacute;e des populations migrantes exprim&eacute;es par Nicolas Sarkozy.</p>\n\n<p>La Manif Pour Tous marche respectueusement dans les pas d'une politique excluante (&agrave; moins que ce ne soit l'inverse) qui ne tol&egrave;re les minorit&eacute;s qu'&agrave; la condition qu'elles s'invisibilisent: la discr&eacute;tion demand&eacute;e aux musulmans par Jean Pierre Chev&egrave;nement l'illustre parfaitement, tout comme l'injonction faite aux homosexuel.le.s de ne pas exprimer ce qui rel&egrave;ve du priv&eacute;, c'est-&agrave;-dire de retourner dans le placard. Un glissement doit ici &ecirc;tre soulign&eacute;. Si le principe la&iuml;c et r&eacute;publicain d'indiff&eacute;rence aux diff&eacute;rences n'a jamais permis une reconnaissance des minorit&eacute;s, les principes de La Manif Pour Tous d&eacute;passent l'indiff&eacute;rence en d&eacute;versant des propos de haine.

It&rsquo;s part of the nonpartisan group&rsquo;s election-focused &ldquo;Take A Stand&rdquo; campaign, launched last November to pressure candidates to spell out their plans for shoring up Social Security&rsquo;s finances. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The &ldquo;Take A Stand&rdquo; initiative </span><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aarp-social-security-campaign_us_56c3854fe4b0c3c55052e81e\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rankled</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> progressive retirement security advocates virtually from the moment it started, because it focused on getting politicians to propose </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">any</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> detailed plan ― and didn&rsquo;t distinguish between reform proposals that would cut benefits and those that would not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new television ad has only heightened liberal concerns. Critics of AARP&rsquo;s approach say that the influential seniors group, which has 37 million members across the country and incredible influence in Washington, is making Social Security&rsquo;s financial challenges seem much more dire than they really are. In doing so, the group is playing right into the crisis framing favored by conservatives, who want benefit cuts to seem inevitable.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;AARP is aggravating a political situation that allows the right, and even Democrats on the center-right in Washington, to portray Social Security as a problem rather than as a vital resource for working people,&rdquo; said Eric Laursen, author of </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The People&rsquo;s Pension: The Struggle To Defend Social Security Since Reagan</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p><div class=\"embed-asset embed\" data-type=\"embed-asset\" data-provider=\"Embed\" data-title=\"\">\n<div class=\"embed-code\"><div><div style=\"left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnqnI9pBmFc?wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\"></iframe></div></div></div></div>\n     <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although there is a heated fight over approaches to reforming Social Security, no one disputes that there is a funding gap in the program that will eventually become a problem. Social Security will not have enough money to pay out its full promised benefits </span><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-security-isnt-broke_us_576ad196e4b0c0252e780295\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by 2034</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, mainly due to the retirement of the large Baby Boomer generation, which has already begun.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the president and Congress fail to reform the program before then ― either by increasing its revenue through tax increases, reducing its benefits or some combination of the two ― an automatic 21-percent cut would go into effect for all beneficiaries.</span></p>\n<p>But context is key. While the funding gap is a problem, it is hardly the crisis many budget hawks ― and AARP&rsquo;s new ad ― have implied. A few small measures to increase revenue, like lifting or eliminating the cap on taxable earnings, would make it possible to extend Social Security&rsquo;s solvency for decades without cutting any benefits. (Americans right now only pay Social Security taxes on the <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/cbb.html\">first $118,500</a> they earn.) <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/oact/solvency/MRubio_20130627.pdf\">Comprehensive immigration reform</a>,&nbsp;which would increase the size of the tax-paying workforce,&nbsp;and policies that reduce income inequality, like <a href=\"http://www.socialsecurityworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Restoring-the-Minimum-Wage-Would-Strengthen-Social-Security-Protections-for-Low-Wage-Workers-and-Strengthen-System-Finances.pdf\">raising the minimum wage</a>, would also boost Social Security&rsquo;s finances.</p>\n<p>Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, a group fighting for an expansion of benefits rather than cuts, said the AARP has been &ldquo;more effective at pushing the crisis framing&rdquo; than the conservative groups that have hyped Social Security&rsquo;s solvency issues precisely because of AARP&rsquo;s credibility among seniors.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the 2016 election nears, Lawson and other progressives fear that the combination of AARP&rsquo;s alarmist rhetoric and its implied blessing for plans that would cut Social Security jeopardizes the success that progressive activists have had in shaping the debate about the program. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AARP did not respond to repeated requests for comment on its campaign or the criticisms of its approach.</span></p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n<span class=\"quote\">The only reason to lead with something like that is to scare people so they accept something worse than they should.</span>\n<span class=\"attribution\">Alex Lawson, Social Security Works</span>\n</blockquote>\n     <p>It&rsquo;s not even clear why AARP would want to stake out such a vague position on reform. Social Security is an immensely popular program. A Pew poll from last year found that <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2016/03/31/campaign-exposes-fissures-over-issues-values-and-how-life-has-changed-in-the-u-s/\">two-thirds of Americans</a> support keeping benefits at their current level. In fact, opposition to cuts was the only major position that unites supporters of all presidential candidates, Democrat and Republican, according to <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/files/2016/03/overview_2.png\">another Pew survey</a> released in March.</p>\n<p>And support for Social Security is likely to rise as more Baby Boomers begin collecting benefits.&nbsp;Over&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/chartbooks/fast_facts/2016/fast_facts16.pdf\">40 million</a>&nbsp;</span>retired workers currently draw from the fund, and that number is set to grow to about 64 million when all of the Boomers retire, according to an estimate by the National Academy for Social Insurance.</p>\n<p>As Lawson put it, &ldquo;more Americans believe in the Loch Ness monster than want to cut Social Security.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That popularity is exactly why fiscal conservatives seeking to cut the program for ideological reasons have resorted to hyping up its&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/transcripts/bushtext_020205.html\">financial challenges</a>. It is apparently easier to develop support for cutting promised benefits if people are not sure they will get those benefits anyway.</p>\n<p>AARP&rsquo;s television ad borrows from that conservative framing. The 30-second spot airing on cable news channels shows younger and middle-aged workers ― a cook, a firefighter, a football coach ― doing their jobs and suggests that candidates for public office are not doing theirs in failing to tackle Social Security&rsquo;s shortfall. It concludes with a warning that Americans could suffer a $10,000 benefit cut if the next president fails to act.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just the ad that has critics concerned about AARP&rsquo;s positioning on Social Security. Just this summer, the group bestowed &nbsp;several of its &ldquo;Champion of the 50+&rdquo; awards on Republican lawmakers who have either explicitly supported benefit cuts or expressed openness to them. GOP recipients included Sen. <a href=\"https://www.ayotte.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=2769\">Kelly Ayotte</a> (R-N.H.), Sen. <a href=\"http://states.aarp.org/aarp-presents-awards-outstanding-community-service-older-adults/\">Richard Burr</a> (R-N.C.) and Rep. <a href=\"http://toddyoung.org/node/3809\">Todd Young</a> (R-Ind.), all of whom are locked in tight Senate races, as well as House Speaker <a href=\"http://www.thewheelerreport.com/wheeler_docs/files/0727aarp.pdf\">Paul Ryan</a> (R-Wis.), who has proposed privatizing Social Security. (The organization has given awards to several Democratic lawmakers as well, including Massachusetts&rsquo; Sen. <a href=\"http://states.aarp.org/aarp-presents-champion-50-award-u-s-senator-elizabeth-warren/\">Elizabeth Warren</a>, who is a leading proponent of expanding Social Security.)</p>\n<p>The Twitter account of AARP&rsquo;s advocacy arm also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AARPadvocates/status/783481486582419456\">praised</a>&nbsp;a controversial question about Social Security&rsquo;s solvency in the vice presidential debate earlier this month.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In 18 years, when the Social Security Trust Funds run out of money, you&rsquo;ll be 76. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates your benefits could be cut by as much as $7,500 per year. What would your administration do to prevent this cut?&rdquo; moderator <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/04/the-mike-pence-vs-tim-kaine-vice-presidential-debate-transcript-annotated/\">Elaine Quijano of CBS News asked</a> Democratic nominee Sen.

But many observers <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/debate-social-security-questions_us_57f4692de4b04c71d6f0e29e\">criticized</a> the question precisely because it invoked a frightening hypothetical that remains distant and extremely unlikely, without offering any additional context.</p><div class=\"embed-asset embed\" data-type=\"embed-asset\" data-provider=\"Embed\" data-title=\"\">\n<div class=\"embed-code\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" align=\"center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It was such a good question!

Leading proponents of benefit cuts, like Andrew Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute, would like to see action on Social Security sooner than later, because the closer we get to the date of the shortfall, the more likely the funding gap would need to be filled with tax hikes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;A tax increase &ndash; particularly on high earners &ndash; can be phased in almost immediately while sudden benefit reductions are seen [as] disruptive to households planning for retirement,&rdquo; </span><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewbiggs/2016/06/22/what-happened-in-the-2016-social-security-trustees-report/#11d8c2322aed\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biggs wrote in June.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ldquo;[AARP is] not coming out and specifically siding with the right, but they give it a certain amount of intellectual legitimacy,&rdquo; said Laursen, the author of </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The People&rsquo;s Pension</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. &ldquo;They are tacitly endorsing the idea that a lot of the ideas progressives naturally oppose are worth talking about, and trying to create an atmosphere where if one does not want to talk about some changes to Social Security, one can be accused of standing in the doorway and preventing the solution to a problem.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Progressive activists who have pushed back against this Social Security alarmism in recent years find this especially disconcerting. At the beginning of Barack Obama&rsquo;s presidency, fiscal conservatives took advantage of public anxiety and confusion over rising budget deficits to create political momentum for cutting Social Security. On more than one occasion, Obama </span><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-grand-bargain-social-security-expansion_us_5751f92de4b0eb20fa0e0142\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">came close</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to approving a deal with congressional Republicans that would have reduced the program&rsquo;s annual cost-of-living adjustment. </span></p>\n<p>But <a href=\"http://www.aflcio.org/About/Exec-Council/EC-Statements/Building-On-The-Success-Of-Social-Security\" target=\"_blank\">organized labor</a>&nbsp;and groups like Social Security Works gradually changed the policy conversation, insisting that the real crisis was the retirement income deficit, which is now <a href=\"http://www.pensionrights.org/newsroom/releases/nations-retirement-income-deficit-now-77-trillion\">$7.7 trillion</a>, according to a calculation from Boston College&rsquo;s Center for Retirement Research. &nbsp;</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n<span class=\"quote\">How do you balance those two objectives: to make it solvent and ensure it must do the job it is supposed to do?</span>\n<span class=\"attribution\">Eric Laursen, author, The People's Pension</span>\n</blockquote>\n     <p>By 2013, advocates had flipped the script and <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/04/can-elizabeth-warren-expand-social-security\" target=\"_blank\">support was growing</a>&nbsp;for an across-the-board expansion of Social Security benefits, to be paid for by making wealthier Americans contribute at a higher level. The private retirement accounts that have replaced traditional pensions don&rsquo;t provide adequate retirement income, the activists argued, so today&rsquo;s workers will need Social Security even more than previous generations. Stagnant wages are making it harder for families to save, they also noted.</p>\n<p>That argument is winning. Nearly all congressional Democrats are on record supporting expansion, as are <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-expand-social-security_us_574f55bfe4b0eb20fa0cb690\">President Obama</a>&nbsp;and Democratic presidential nominee <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/hillary-clinton/\">Hillary Clinton</a>. Though Clinton has yet to roll out a detailed plan for how she would pay for it, she has indicated she supports lifting the cap on taxable earnings and finding other ways to make wealthy Americans pay more into the program. Meanwhile, GOP nominee <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a> <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-social-security_us_56e2f2f6e4b0b25c9181b5a3\">claims</a> he would at least protect the program from cuts.</p>\n<p><span id=\":5i3.co\" class=\"tL8wMe EMoHub\" dir=\"ltr\">In spite of the evolution of the debate, AARP&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;Take A Stand&rdquo; campaign suggests it still views program exclusively through the lens of financial solvency.</span></p>\n<p>If AARP were concerned about retirement security overall, surely its ads would focus more on the adequacy of Social Security benefits and not just the program&rsquo;s solvency. &nbsp;A more constructive campaign from the seniors group, said Laursen, would ask politicians to both address Social Security&rsquo;s solvency and its increasingly vital role as a source of retirement income.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is a lot of evidence it needs to be conserved and expanded to serve the needs of the 21st century workforce, [which will be] retiring without the pensions of past generations,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How do you balance those two objectives: to make it solvent and ensure it must do the job it is supposed to do?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Laursen speculates that AARP&rsquo;s unwillingness to weigh in on the merits of particular Social Security reform plans likely stems from a desire to avoid being seen as partisan, which could alienate some members.</p>\n<p>Taking a Democratic-leaning stand created problems for AARP in the recent past; the group lost some <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304704504579433343591891948\">300,000 members</a> when it threw its weight behind the Affordable Care Act in 2009.</p><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n<span class=\"quote\">AARP may be responding to data they must have about X-ers' and Millennials’ deep doubts about the future of entitlements.</span>\n<span class=\"attribution\">Frederick Lynch, Claremont McKenna College</span>\n</blockquote>\n     <p>Now AARP also has some longtime Republican operatives running the campaign. <a href=\"http://www.aarp.org/about-aarp/press-center/info-06-2011/aarp-appoints-two-seasoned-political-strategists-to-state-and-national-group.html\">John Hishta</a>, who as AARP&rsquo;s senior vice president for campaigns runs &ldquo;Take A Stand,&rdquo; has a background in Republican politics. He served as executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee from 2001 to 2002 and as chief of staff to former Virginia Rep. Tom Davis (R) before that. And the group has hired veteran GOP pollster and message guru <a href=\"http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/government-elections/info-2016/presidential-debate-issues-jh.html\">Frank Luntz</a> to conduct focus groups for &ldquo;Take A Stand.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But AARP has also responded to liberal pressure this election season. In August,&nbsp;after a progressive research outfit <a href=\"http://www.exposedbycmd.org/2016/07/28/revealed-aarp-funding-alec/\">exposed</a>&nbsp;the group&rsquo;s involvement with the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aarp-to-withdraw-from-alec_us_57a4c72de4b03ba6801233e5\">AARP announced</a> that it would let its ALEC membership expire at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>AARP <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aarp-social-security-campaign_us_56c3854fe4b0c3c55052e81e\">told HuffPost in February</a> that the organization wanted to wait until after the election to publicize its view of specific Social Security provisions. It has not hesitated to differentiate between different Social Security proposals before past elections, however. In 2012, AARP published a <a href=\"http://www.aarp.org/about-aarp/press-center/info-08-2012/AARP-Releases-Voters-Guides-for-Presidential-Senate-Congressional-Candidates.html\">voters&rsquo; guide</a> comparing presidential and congressional candidates&rsquo; views on Social Security and Medicare alongside AARP&rsquo;s &ldquo;principles&rdquo; for the programs.</p>\n<p>AARP has touted data on the views of its current members to promote &ldquo;Take A Stand.&rdquo; Sixty-seven percent of the 23,000 members <a href=\"http://www.aarp.org/about-aarp/press-center/info-09-2016/aarp-urges-debate-candidates-to-address-to-social-security-challenges.html\">surveyed by AARP</a> said the future of Social Security is their top election concern.</p>\n<p>Frederick Lynch, author of the book <em>One Nation Under AARP:&nbsp;The Fight Over Medicare, Social Security, and America&rsquo;s Future</em> and a professor at Claremont McKenna College, speculated that the group&rsquo;s focus on Social Security&rsquo;s solvency is an attempt to appeal to younger Americans, whom it views as its future members.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;AARP may be responding to data they must have about X-er and Millennials&rsquo; deep doubts about the future of entitlements,&rdquo; Lynch said.</p>\n<p>But even if younger voters lack confidence in the future of Social Security, they clearly don&rsquo;t support scaling it back in order to secure it. The Pew poll from last year found that <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/18/5-facts-about-social-security/\">61 percent</a> of millennials oppose cutting benefits.</p>\n<p>As Social Security Works&rsquo; Lawson argues, the public wants politicians &ldquo;to take the <em>right</em> stand, not <em>a </em>stand.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We know what that is and so does AARP,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They know what their members want, and saying anything else is ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>",

    "plain_text": "\nWASHINGTON ― Television viewers across the country have been treated to some scary advertisements about the future of Social Security.\n\n“Our next president needs to take action on Social Security, or future generations could lose up to $10,000 a year,” the narrator intones, as ominous music plays in the background.\n\nViewers might be surprised to learn that the ad is from the AARP, the country’s largest seniors group and a longtime defender of social programs for older Americans. It’s part of the nonpartisan group’s election-focused “Take A Stand” campaign, launched last November to pressure candidates to spell out their plans for shoring up Social Security’s finances. \n\nThe “Take A Stand” initiative rankled progressive retirement security advocates virtually from the moment it started, because it focused on getting politicians to propose any detailed plan ― and didn’t distinguish between reform proposals that would cut benefits and those that would not. \n\nThe new television ad has only heightened liberal concerns. Critics of AARP’s approach say that the influential seniors group, which has 37 million members across the country and incredible influence in Washington, is making Social Security’s financial challenges seem much more dire than they really are. In doing so, the group is playing right into the crisis framing favored by conservatives, who want benefit cuts to seem inevitable.\n\n“AARP is aggravating a political situation that allows the right, and even Democrats on the center-right in Washington, to portray Social Security as a problem rather than as a vital resource for working people,” said Eric Laursen, author of The People’s Pension: The Struggle To Defend Social Security Since Reagan. \n\n     \nAlthough there is a heated fight over approaches to reforming Social Security, no one disputes that there is a funding gap in the program that will eventually become a problem. Social Security will not have enough money to pay out its full promised benefits by 2034, mainly due to the retirement of the large Baby Boomer generation, which has already begun. \n\nIf the president and Congress fail to reform the program before then ― either by increasing its revenue through tax increases, reducing its benefits or some combination of the two ― an automatic 21-percent cut would go into effect for all beneficiaries.\n\nBut context is key. While the funding gap is a problem, it is hardly the crisis many budget hawks ― and AARP’s new ad ― have implied. A few small measures to increase revenue, like lifting or eliminating the cap on taxable earnings, would make it possible to extend Social Security’s solvency for decades without cutting any benefits. (Americans right now only pay Social Security taxes on the first $118,500 they earn.) Comprehensive immigration reform, which would increase the size of the tax-paying workforce, and policies that reduce income inequality, like raising the minimum wage, would also boost Social Security’s finances.\n\nAlex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, a group fighting for an expansion of benefits rather than cuts, said the AARP has been “more effective at pushing the crisis framing” than the conservative groups that have hyped Social Security’s solvency issues precisely because of AARP’s credibility among seniors.\n\nAs the 2016 election nears, Lawson and other progressives fear that the combination of AARP’s alarmist rhetoric and its implied blessing for plans that would cut Social Security jeopardizes the success that progressive activists have had in shaping the debate about the program. \n\nAARP did not respond to repeated requests for comment on its campaign or the criticisms of its approach.\nThe only reason to lead with something like that is to scare people so they accept something worse than they should.\nAlex Lawson, Social Security Works\n\n     \nIt’s not even clear why AARP would want to stake out such a vague position on reform. Social Security is an immensely popular program. A Pew poll from last year found that two-thirds of Americans support keeping benefits at their current level. In fact, opposition to cuts was the only major position that unites supporters of all presidential candidates, Democrat and Republican, according to another Pew survey released in March.\n\nAnd support for Social Security is likely to rise as more Baby Boomers begin collecting benefits. Over 40 million retired workers currently draw from the fund, and that number is set to grow to about 64 million when all of the Boomers retire, according to an estimate by the National Academy for Social Insurance.\n\nAs Lawson put it, “more Americans believe in the Loch Ness monster than want to cut Social Security.”\n\nThat popularity is exactly why fiscal conservatives seeking to cut the program for ideological reasons have resorted to hyping up its financial challenges. It is apparently easier to develop support for cutting promised benefits if people are not sure they will get those benefits anyway.\n\nAARP’s television ad borrows from that conservative framing. The 30-second spot airing on cable news channels shows younger and middle-aged workers ― a cook, a firefighter, a football coach ― doing their jobs and suggests that candidates for public office are not doing theirs in failing to tackle Social Security’s shortfall. It concludes with a warning that Americans could suffer a $10,000 benefit cut if the next president fails to act.\n\nIt’s not just the ad that has critics concerned about AARP’s positioning on Social Security. Just this summer, the group bestowed  several of its “Champion of the 50+” awards on Republican lawmakers who have either explicitly supported benefit cuts or expressed openness to them. GOP recipients included Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Rep. Todd Young (R-Ind.), all of whom are locked in tight Senate races, as well as House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who has proposed privatizing Social Security. (The organization has given awards to several Democratic lawmakers as well, including Massachusetts’ Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is a leading proponent of expanding Social Security.)\n\nThe Twitter account of AARP’s advocacy arm also praised a controversial question about Social Security’s solvency in the vice presidential debate earlier this month.\n\n“In 18 years, when the Social Security Trust Funds run out of money, you’ll be 76. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates your benefits could be cut by as much as $7,500 per year. What would your administration do to prevent this cut?” moderator Elaine Quijano of CBS News asked Democratic nominee Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.)\n\n“It was such a good question!” effused AARP Advocates. But many observers criticized the question precisely because it invoked a frightening hypothetical that remains distant and extremely unlikely, without offering any additional context.\n\nIt was such a good question! Future retirees could lose up to $10K a year if our next president doesn't commit to action. #TakeAStand https://t.co/a2ZxmvHdSf— AARP Advocates (@AARPadvocates) October 5, 2016\n\n     \nAARP is “saying that Social Security is in this dire situation, that something needs to be done immediately,” Social Security Works’ Lawson said.\n\n“It is an absolute falsehood,” he continued. “The only reason to lead with something like that is to scare people so they accept something worse than they should.”\n\nIndeed, time is on progressives’ side when it comes to reforming Social Security. Leading proponents of benefit cuts, like Andrew Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute, would like to see action on Social Security sooner than later, because the closer we get to the date of the shortfall, the more likely the funding gap would need to be filled with tax hikes. \n\n“A tax increase – particularly on high earners – can be phased in almost immediately while sudden benefit reductions are seen [as] disruptive to households planning for retirement,” Biggs wrote in June.\n\n“[AARP is] not coming out and specifically siding with the right, but they give it a certain amount of intellectual legitimacy,” said Laursen, the author of The People’s Pension. “They are tacitly endorsing the idea that a lot of the ideas progressives naturally oppose are worth talking about, and trying to create an atmosphere where if one does not want to talk about some changes to Social Security, one can be accused of standing in the doorway and preventing the solution to a problem.”\n\nProgressive activists who have pushed back against this Social Security alarmism in recent years find this especially disconcerting. At the beginning of Barack Obama’s presidency, fiscal conservatives took advantage of public anxiety and confusion over rising budget deficits to create political momentum for cutting Social Security. On more than one occasion, Obama came close to approving a deal with congressional Republicans that would have reduced the program’s annual cost-of-living adjustment. \n\nBut organized labor and groups like Social Security Works gradually changed the policy conversation, insisting that the real crisis was the retirement income deficit, which is now $7.7 trillion, according to a calculation from Boston College’s Center for Retirement Research.  \nHow do you balance those two objectives: to make it solvent and ensure it must do the job it is supposed to do?\nEric Laursen, author, The People's Pension\n\n     \nBy 2013, advocates had flipped the script and support was growing for an across-the-board expansion of Social Security benefits, to be paid for by making wealthier Americans contribute at a higher level. The private retirement accounts that have replaced traditional pensions don’t provide adequate retirement income, the activists argued, so today’s workers will need Social Security even more than previous generations. Stagnant wages are making it harder for families to save, they also noted.\n\nThat argument is winning. Nearly all congressional Democrats are on record supporting expansion, as are President Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Though Clinton has yet to roll out a detailed plan for how she would pay for it, she has indicated she supports lifting the cap on taxable earnings and finding other ways to make wealthy Americans pay more into the program. Meanwhile, GOP nominee Donald Trump claims he would at least protect the program from cuts.\n\nIn spite of the evolution of the debate, AARP’s “Take A Stand” campaign suggests it still views program exclusively through the lens of financial solvency.\n\nIf AARP were concerned about retirement security overall, surely its ads would focus more on the adequacy of Social Security benefits and not just the program’s solvency.  A more constructive campaign from the seniors group, said Laursen, would ask politicians to both address Social Security’s solvency and its increasingly vital role as a source of retirement income.\n\n“There is a lot of evidence it needs to be conserved and expanded to serve the needs of the 21st century workforce, [which will be] retiring without the pensions of past generations,” he said. “How do you balance those two objectives: to make it solvent and ensure it must do the job it is supposed to do?”\n\nLaursen speculates that AARP’s unwillingness to weigh in on the merits of particular Social Security reform plans likely stems from a desire to avoid being seen as partisan, which could alienate some members.\n\nTaking a Democratic-leaning stand created problems for AARP in the recent past; the group lost some 300,000 members when it threw its weight behind the Affordable Care Act in 2009.\nAARP may be responding to data they must have about X-ers' and Millennials’ deep doubts about the future of entitlements.\nFrederick Lynch, Claremont McKenna College\n\n     \nNow AARP also has some longtime Republican operatives running the campaign. John Hishta, who as AARP’s senior vice president for campaigns runs “Take A Stand,” has a background in Republican politics. He served as executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee from 2001 to 2002 and as chief of staff to former Virginia Rep. Tom Davis (R) before that. And the group has hired veteran GOP pollster and message guru Frank Luntz to conduct focus groups for “Take A Stand.”\n\nBut AARP has also responded to liberal pressure this election season. In August, after a progressive research outfit exposed the group’s involvement with the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, AARP announced that it would let its ALEC membership expire at the end of the year.\n\nAARP told HuffPost in February that the organization wanted to wait until after the election to publicize its view of specific Social Security provisions. It has not hesitated to differentiate between different Social Security proposals before past elections, however. In 2012, AARP published a voters’ guide comparing presidential and congressional candidates’ views on Social Security and Medicare alongside AARP’s “principles” for the programs.\n\nAARP has touted data on the views of its current members to promote “Take A Stand.” Sixty-seven percent of the 23,000 members surveyed by AARP said the future of Social Security is their top election concern.\n\nFrederick Lynch, author of the book One Nation Under AARP: The Fight Over Medicare, Social Security, and America’s Future and a professor at Claremont McKenna College, speculated that the group’s focus on Social Security’s solvency is an attempt to appeal to younger Americans, whom it views as its future members. \n\n“AARP may be responding to data they must have about X-er and Millennials’ deep doubts about the future of entitlements,” Lynch said.\n\nBut even if younger voters lack confidence in the future of Social Security, they clearly don’t support scaling it back in order to secure it. The Pew poll from last year found that 61 percent of millennials oppose cutting benefits.\n\nAs Social Security Works’ Lawson argues, the public wants politicians “to take the right stand, not a stand.”\n\n“We know what that is and so does AARP,” he said. “They know what their members want, and saying anything else is ridiculous.”",

Well, urine for a treat. A stream of pee worries plague people&rsquo;s minds every day. For answers on this toilet topic, U.S. News talked to Dr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary, a senior urologic surgeon at <span class=\"html-tag\"><a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/ma/brigham-and-womens-hospital-6140215\" target=\"_blank\">Brigham and Women&rsquo;s Hospital</a></span>, and Dr. Benjamin Davies, associate professor of urology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and chief of urology at UPMC Shadyside/Hillman Cancer Center. So consider this your primer on pee.</p>\n<h4>What color should my pee be?</h4>\n<p>This may come as a shock, but according to Davies, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t care about the color of your pee particularly,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Many foods can change the color of your pee. If you down a whole bunch of beets your pee is gonna be red.&rdquo; He also says <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/2013/06/27/best-fat-burning-foods\" target=\"_blank\">asparagus</a>&nbsp;can make your pee green. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t really use [color] as a barometer for your health, unless you&rsquo;re trying to make sure you&rsquo;re hydrated, and we want to see that it&rsquo;s relatively clear,&rdquo; he adds. If your pee is a darker shade, like dark yellow or even amber, you&rsquo;re not getting enough fluids. &ldquo;Urine ought to be closer to clear than it is to dark yellow,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Leary explains.</p>\n<h4>How often should I pee?</h4>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no &ldquo;normal&rdquo; amount, per se, experts say. Healthy people with <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2016-06-30/please-give-me-your-kidney-how-to-crowdsource-for-an-organ\" target=\"_blank\">healthy kidneys</a>&nbsp;produce 2 liters of urine a day (about 68 ounces); since normal bladder capacity is between 300 to 400 cubic centimeters, that means you&rsquo;re going about five times per day, O&rsquo;Leary says. However: What&rsquo;s normal for one person may not be normal for another, so there&rsquo;s no need to compare, he adds. Caveat: If you feel like you&rsquo;re going more than normal, discuss it with your doctor. It could signal something more serious, <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/best-diet/best-diabetes-diets\" target=\"_blank\">like diabetes</a>.</p>\n<h4>Is there a proper pee stance?</h4>\n<p>Men, indeed, can pee standing up or sitting down. But men who <em>have</em>&nbsp;to sit down to pee should see a <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/doctors\" target=\"_blank\">physician</a>. &ldquo;If you have to sit down to urinate to push it out, there&rsquo;s a fancy name for that called credeing, that&rsquo;s basically because you have to use your abdominal muscles to pee,&rdquo; Davies says. &ldquo;So you have to sit down, and you tense your abdominal muscles and get your urine out. Obviously, that&rsquo;s a sign of a problem.&rdquo; That being said, it might be a good idea for men of a certain age to sit down even if they&rsquo;re just peeing. &ldquo;I encourage men, particularly older guys, [to do this], &lsquo;cause older guys are more likely to get up at night to void, and risk of falling increases with aging,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Leary says.</p>\n<h4>Is the &ldquo;breaking the seal&rdquo; myth true?</h4>\n<p>You know the drill. You&rsquo;re out to drinks with friends when you feel the sudden urge to urinate. It&rsquo;s commonly known as &ldquo;breaking the seal&rdquo; &ndash; the idea that your initial jaunt to the restroom will trigger a barrage of trips thereafter. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no great science there,&rdquo; Davies said, dismissing this legendary bar fable. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no &lsquo;breaking the seal,&rsquo; I hate to tell you.&rdquo; In other words, when you&rsquo;ve got to go, you&rsquo;ve got to go.</p>\n<p>As far as myths go, Davies and O&rsquo;Leary also debunked another: healing a jellyfish sting by urinating on it. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think urine is generally considered therapeutic in any way shape or form,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Leary says.</p>\n<h4>What should I do if I pee blood?</h4>\n<p>While <span class=\"html-tag\"><a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/2013/06/10/3-healthy-recipes-with-beets\" target=\"_blank\">beets</a></span>&nbsp;may make your pee look red, urinating blood is a different story. Blood in your urine is never something to ignore, O&rsquo;Leary says. It could be something as serious as bladder or <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2015/01/21/prostate-cancer-to-treat-or-not-to-treat\" target=\"_blank\">prostate cancer</a>, but also as benign as having exercised or developed a bladder or <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2015/09/18/the-burning-truth-about-urinary-tract-infections\" target=\"_blank\">urinary tract infection</a>, Davies adds. Age and medical status play a part in this, too. Long story short: See your doctor.</p>\n<h4>What do I do when it hurts to pee?</h4>\n<p>Painful urination could be signs of a bladder or urinary tract infection, a <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2016-03-16/seniors-and-sexual-health-what-older-adults-should-know\" target=\"_blank\">sexually transmitted disease</a>&nbsp;or stricture (or abnormal narrowing) of your urethra &ndash; so generally, you should tell your doctor, Davies says. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s painful or burning when you&rsquo;re urinating, the first thing you think about is possible infection,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Leary adds. &ldquo;More common in women than in men.&rdquo;</p>\n<h4>Why does asparagus make my pee smell?</h4>\n<p>It&rsquo;s complicated. &ldquo;People who have the enzyme asparaginase, it breaks down asparagine, which is what is in asparagus, and their urine doesn&rsquo;t smell,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Leary says. &ldquo;The other ones just don&rsquo;t have the gene for the enzyme.&rdquo; Davies offers a different theory: You&rsquo;re smelling asparagusic acid, which your body transforms into smelly, sulfur-containing chemicals. &ldquo;It has to do with your ability to smell rather than the actual pee. Some people smell asparagus in their urine, others do not, he explains.</p>\n<h4>Is it bad to hold my pee in?</h4>\n<p>Holding your pee in during that <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/wellness/articles/2016-06-09/how-to-turn-your-commute-into-a-workout\" target=\"_blank\">long bus ride home from work</a>&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t inherently an issue. But making it a chronic habit may not be the best idea, as that&rsquo;s training your bladder to hold more and more urine beyond the 300 to 400 cc limit. &ldquo;I think it isn&rsquo;t ever a good idea to really, seriously postpone urination,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Leary says. Davies agrees, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you should hold it in for the whole day ... but you&rsquo;re not gonna hurt yourself by holding in your urine.&rdquo;</p>\n<h4>Could I ever pee too much?</h4>\n<p>Yes, and it could actually be a sign of a larger health issue. &ldquo;People with diabetes often will present with urinating too much,&rdquo; Davies says. This includes both the more rare diabetes insipidus (a salt and water metabolism disorder that makes you thirsty and indeed, pee heavily) and mellitus (what&rsquo;s generally <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/rankings/diabetes-and-endocrinology\" target=\"_blank\">referred to as diabetes</a>, when your blood has too much sugar). People can also create this problem themselves, which can upset daily routines and lifestyle. &ldquo;We see patients all the time who train their bladders to empty frequently,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Leary says. Peeing too much could also be a sign of overactive bladder, a chronic condition, Davies adds, though for some folks it may manifest as the sudden urge to urinate.</p>\n<h4>Is urine sterile? Does that mean I can drink it?</h4>\n<p>Yes, urine is sterile, Davies confirms. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should drink it. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want you drinking your pee,&rdquo; he says. The trend of &ldquo;urotherapy,&rdquo; in which you drink pee or put it on yourself in hopes of achieving <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/slideshows/the-best-foods-for-your-skin\" target=\"_blank\">clearer skin</a>&nbsp;and an energy boost, isn&rsquo;t generally advisable unless you&rsquo;re fighting to survive. &ldquo;Since I&rsquo;m not aware of any real studies looking at this issue in particular, my advice would be to not get stranded,&rdquo; Davies says. &ldquo;Urotherapy is bizarre, disgusting and not endorsed by any serious professionals.&rdquo;</p>\n<h4>What if I feel like I have to pee, but nothing comes out?</h4>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t fret just yet. &ldquo;That happens to a lot of people, very, very common, both in men and women,&rdquo; Davies says. &ldquo;Usually that&rsquo;s over your bladder kind of being overactive, or overly sensitive.&rdquo; It could, however, be a sign of something more serious, depending on factors like the patient&rsquo;s age, <a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2015/07/23/health-history-reconciliation-why-you-need-a-pocket-card-of-information\" target=\"_blank\">medical history</a>&nbsp;or tagalong symptoms, according to Davies.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/wellness/slideshows/what-color-should-my-pee-be-a-stream-of-urine-questions-answered\" target=\"_blank\">What Color Should My Pee Be?</a> was originally published on U.S. News &amp; World Report.</em></p>\n<p><strong>More from U.S. News:<br /></strong><a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/slideshows/how-often-should-i-poop-and-other-toilet-topics\" target=\"_blank\">How Often Should I Poop, and Other Toilet Topics <br /></a><a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/wellness/slideshows/what-to-eat-drink-and-do-to-relieve-constipation\" target=\"_blank\">What to Eat, Drink and Do to Relieve Constipation<br /></a><a href=\"http://health.usnews.com/wellness/slideshows/8-ways-to-stay-hydrated-this-summer-without-drinking-water\" target=\"_blank\">8 Ways to Stay Hydrated This Summer Without Drinking Water&nbsp;</a></p>",

    "plain_text": "\nAre you practically bursting to know more about pee, but have been too embarrassed to ask your questions aloud? Well, urine for a treat. A stream of pee worries plague people’s minds every day. For answers on this toilet topic, U.S. News talked to Dr. Michael O’Leary, a senior urologic surgeon at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Dr. Benjamin Davies, associate professor of urology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and chief of urology at UPMC Shadyside/Hillman Cancer Center. So consider this your primer on pee.\nWhat color should my pee be?\n\nThis may come as a shock, but according to Davies, it doesn’t really matter. “We don’t care about the color of your pee particularly,” he says. “Many foods can change the color of your pee. If you down a whole bunch of beets your pee is gonna be red.” He also says asparagus can make your pee green. “We don’t really use [color] as a barometer for your health, unless you’re trying to make sure you’re hydrated, and we want to see that it’s relatively clear,” he adds. If your pee is a darker shade, like dark yellow or even amber, you’re not getting enough fluids. “Urine ought to be closer to clear than it is to dark yellow,” O’Leary explains.\nHow often should I pee?\n\nThere’s no “normal” amount, per se, experts say. Healthy people with healthy kidneys produce 2 liters of urine a day (about 68 ounces); since normal bladder capacity is between 300 to 400 cubic centimeters, that means you’re going about five times per day, O’Leary says. However: What’s normal for one person may not be normal for another, so there’s no need to compare, he adds. Caveat: If you feel like you’re going more than normal, discuss it with your doctor. It could signal something more serious, like diabetes.\nIs there a proper pee stance?\n\nMen, indeed, can pee standing up or sitting down. But men who have to sit down to pee should see a physician. “If you have to sit down to urinate to push it out, there’s a fancy name for that called credeing, that’s basically because you have to use your abdominal muscles to pee,” Davies says. “So you have to sit down, and you tense your abdominal muscles and get your urine out. Obviously, that’s a sign of a problem.” That being said, it might be a good idea for men of a certain age to sit down even if they’re just peeing. “I encourage men, particularly older guys, [to do this], ‘cause older guys are more likely to get up at night to void, and risk of falling increases with aging,” O’Leary says.\nIs the “breaking the seal” myth true?\n\nYou know the drill. You’re out to drinks with friends when you feel the sudden urge to urinate. It’s commonly known as “breaking the seal” – the idea that your initial jaunt to the restroom will trigger a barrage of trips thereafter. “There’s no great science there,” Davies said, dismissing this legendary bar fable. “There’s no ‘breaking the seal,’ I hate to tell you.” In other words, when you’ve got to go, you’ve got to go.\n\nAs far as myths go, Davies and O’Leary also debunked another: healing a jellyfish sting by urinating on it. “I don’t think urine is generally considered therapeutic in any way shape or form,” O’Leary says.\nWhat should I do if I pee blood?\n\nWhile beets may make your pee look red, urinating blood is a different story. Blood in your urine is never something to ignore, O’Leary says. It could be something as serious as bladder or prostate cancer, but also as benign as having exercised or developed a bladder or urinary tract infection, Davies adds. Age and medical status play a part in this, too. Long story short: See your doctor.\nWhat do I do when it hurts to pee?\n\nPainful urination could be signs of a bladder or urinary tract infection, a sexually transmitted disease or stricture (or abnormal narrowing) of your urethra – so generally, you should tell your doctor, Davies says. “If it’s painful or burning when you’re urinating, the first thing you think about is possible infection,” O’Leary adds. “More common in women than in men.”\nWhy does asparagus make my pee smell?\n\nIt’s complicated. “People who have the enzyme asparaginase, it breaks down asparagine, which is what is in asparagus, and their urine doesn’t smell,” O’Leary says. “The other ones just don’t have the gene for the enzyme.” Davies offers a different theory: You’re smelling asparagusic acid, which your body transforms into smelly, sulfur-containing chemicals. “It has to do with your ability to smell rather than the actual pee. Some people smell asparagus in their urine, others do not, he explains.\nIs it bad to hold my pee in?\n\nHolding your pee in during that long bus ride home from work isn’t inherently an issue. But making it a chronic habit may not be the best idea, as that’s training your bladder to hold more and more urine beyond the 300 to 400 cc limit. “I think it isn’t ever a good idea to really, seriously postpone urination,” O’Leary says. Davies agrees, “I don’t think you should hold it in for the whole day ... but you’re not gonna hurt yourself by holding in your urine.”\nCould I ever pee too much?\n\nYes, and it could actually be a sign of a larger health issue. “People with diabetes often will present with urinating too much,” Davies says. This includes both the more rare diabetes insipidus (a salt and water metabolism disorder that makes you thirsty and indeed, pee heavily) and mellitus (what’s generally referred to as diabetes, when your blood has too much sugar). People can also create this problem themselves, which can upset daily routines and lifestyle. “We see patients all the time who train their bladders to empty frequently,” O’Leary says. Peeing too much could also be a sign of overactive bladder, a chronic condition, Davies adds, though for some folks it may manifest as the sudden urge to urinate.\nIs urine sterile? Does that mean I can drink it?\n\nYes, urine is sterile, Davies confirms. But that doesn’t mean you should drink it. “We don’t want you drinking your pee,” he says. The trend of “urotherapy,” in which you drink pee or put it on yourself in hopes of achieving clearer skin and an energy boost, isn’t generally advisable unless you’re fighting to survive. “Since I’m not aware of any real studies looking at this issue in particular, my advice would be to not get stranded,” Davies says. “Urotherapy is bizarre, disgusting and not endorsed by any serious professionals.”\nWhat if I feel like I have to pee, but nothing comes out?\n\nDon’t fret just yet. “That happens to a lot of people, very, very common, both in men and women,” Davies says. “Usually that’s over your bladder kind of being overactive, or overly sensitive.” It could, however, be a sign of something more serious, depending on factors like the patient’s age, medical history or tagalong symptoms, according to Davies.\n\nWhat Color Should My Pee Be? was originally published on U.S. News & World Report.\n\nMore from U.S. News:\nHow Often Should I Poop, and Other Toilet Topics \nWhat to Eat, Drink and Do to Relieve Constipation\n8 Ways to Stay Hydrated This Summer Without Drinking Water ",

In 1916, people came to this incredible city to fulfill their dreams and build their lives, and Planned Parenthood helped them to do just that. 100 years later, people from all over the country and the world come to New York and Planned Parenthood for the very same reasons.\n\nNew York City has always been one of the nation's leading hubs of progressive change, and it isn't a coincidence that we started here. In the early 1900s, New Yorkers led many fights - for voting rights, improved working conditions, fair wages, and the right to form unions. It was only fitting that the movement for reproductive health and rights has its origins in our city as part of a broad effort for social change. \n\nSince then, incredible gains have been made. Planned Parenthood of New York City has been at the forefront of expanding access to birth control, ensuring the availability of safe and legal abortion, and getting coverage for preventive care and birth control under the Affordable Care Act. Today, we continue to be a champion in expanding access to sexual and reproductive health care, improving sexuality education, and advocating for policies that make the lives of New Yorkers better every day.  \n\nWe've grown as the city has grown, and we've changed and adapted as the communities we serve have changed. Our services have expanded to serve more New Yorkers, including men, young adults and the LGBTQ community. Our goal is to make every person who comes through our doors feels welcome, comfortable, and cared for while receiving the best possible medical care. \n\nThis movement, however, is not only about health care, and it isn't the result of our work alone. Addressing various social justice issues is an essential component of our work, since many of the communities that we serve experience systemic oppressions dictated by race, gender, ethnicity, income, immigration status, ability, and more. We work in coalition, alongside and in support of social justice organizations to fight these forms of oppression and work towards a world where all people have bodily autonomy. \n\nSo much has changed in the last century and the expansion of our services is a testament to our commitment to improving the lives of all people - no matter what. But even after 100 years, one thing remains the same. In 1916, women lined up down the block in our clinic in Brownsville to get information on how to prevent or plan pregnancy -- information that was completely illegal at the time. And every day, PPNYC's dedicated doctors, clinicians and staff continue to provide expert, respectful care. \n\nPPNYC's vision has always been to work toward a world where people have full control of their bodies and destinies. As we commemorate the extraordinary achievements over Planned Parenthood's first 100 years, we are proud to launch our second century with as much passion, courage and conviction as our first. ",

    "plain_text": "\n\nToday, Planned Parenthood turns 100 years strong, and it all started right here in New York City. \n\nBeginning as a small clinic in Brownsville, Brooklyn in 1916, Planned Parenthood of New York City (PPNYC) now provides sexual and reproductive health care services and information to more than 64,000 New Yorkers each year in our five health centers - one in each borough, and reaches another 25,000 through our extensive sex education programs.\n\nSince our founding, PPNYC has been part of the fabric of New York City. In 1916, people came to this incredible city to fulfill their dreams and build their lives, and Planned Parenthood helped them to do just that. 100 years later, people from all over the country and the world come to New York and Planned Parenthood for the very same reasons.\n\nNew York City has always been one of the nation's leading hubs of progressive change, and it isn't a coincidence that we started here. In the early 1900s, New Yorkers led many fights - for voting rights, improved working conditions, fair wages, and the right to form unions. It was only fitting that the movement for reproductive health and rights has its origins in our city as part of a broad effort for social change. \n\nSince then, incredible gains have been made. Planned Parenthood of New York City has been at the forefront of expanding access to birth control, ensuring the availability of safe and legal abortion, and getting coverage for preventive care and birth control under the Affordable Care Act. Today, we continue to be a champion in expanding access to sexual and reproductive health care, improving sexuality education, and advocating for policies that make the lives of New Yorkers better every day.  \n\nWe've grown as the city has grown, and we've changed and adapted as the communities we serve have changed. Our services have expanded to serve more New Yorkers, including men, young adults and the LGBTQ community. Our goal is to make every person who comes through our doors feels welcome, comfortable, and cared for while receiving the best possible medical care. \n\nThis movement, however, is not only about health care, and it isn't the result of our work alone. Addressing various social justice issues is an essential component of our work, since many of the communities that we serve experience systemic oppressions dictated by race, gender, ethnicity, income, immigration status, ability, and more. We work in coalition, alongside and in support of social justice organizations to fight these forms of oppression and work towards a world where all people have bodily autonomy. \n\nSo much has changed in the last century and the expansion of our services is a testament to our commitment to improving the lives of all people - no matter what. But even after 100 years, one thing remains the same. In 1916, women lined up down the block in our clinic in Brownsville to get information on how to prevent or plan pregnancy -- information that was completely illegal at the time. And every day, PPNYC's dedicated doctors, clinicians and staff continue to provide expert, respectful care. \n\nPPNYC's vision has always been to work toward a world where people have full control of their bodies and destinies. As we commemorate the extraordinary achievements over Planned Parenthood's first 100 years, we are proud to launch our second century with as much passion, courage and conviction as our first. ",

Sur sc&egrave;ne, Jean-Luc M&eacute;lenchon a longuement d&eacute;fendu le principe de la \"planification &eacute;cologique\" comme un rem&egrave;de &agrave; \"la soci&eacute;t&eacute; monstrueuse du d&eacute;chet\". \"Si l'on ne planifie pas, on ne pourra pas faire la transition &eacute;cologique\", a-t-il plaid&eacute;.</p>\n\n<p>S'aga&ccedil;ant que l'on renvoie sans cesse la planification &agrave; l'URSS, l'eurod&eacute;put&eacute; a rappel&eacute; que le g&eacute;n&eacute;ral De Gaulle avait lui-m&ecirc;me choisi le plan pour reconstruire la France: \"ce n'&eacute;tait pas un communiste avec un couteau entre les dents\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>R&eacute;volution institutionnelle pour \"refonder le peuple\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Autres priorit&eacute;s, un peu plus d'un tiers des votants (35,5%) souhaitent valoriser dans la campagne \"le droit de r&eacute;voquer un(e) &eacute;lu(e)\" et 35% le r&eacute;f&eacute;rendum pour engager le processus de r&eacute;union d'une Assembl&eacute;e constituante.

Je ne peux pas être le président de la République qui applique ce programme sans que le peuple tout entier s'en mêle\", a déclaré Jean-Luc Mélenchon au début d'un discours fleuve sur le mode du stand-up dans lequel il a défendu \"la planification écologique\" comme alternative à \"l'esclavage\" du libre-échange.\n\n\nContre \"la société monstrueuse du déchet\"\n\n\n\"Il s'agit de 10 mesures emblématiques qui serviront de support à la campagne, à partir desquelles on va fabriquer du matériel électoral, ça donne une idée de l'orientation générale du mouvement\", a expliqué à la presse Charlotte Girard, coordinatrice du projet.\n\n\nLe refus du traité de libre-échange en cours de négociations avec les Etats-Unis (Tafta) et celui déjà abouti avec le Canada (Ceta) arrive en première place, avec 48% des voix. \"Si ces accords sont appliqués, c'est le contraire de tout ce à quoi nous aspirons\" qui interviendra, s'est félicité sur scène Jean-Luc Mélenchon.

    "plain_text": "\nPOLITIQUE - François Hollande avait-il vraiment besoin de cela ? À un peu plus de six mois de l'élection présidentielle, le président de la République a vu sortir un ouvrage à l'effet dévastateur. Dans \"Un président ne devrait pas...\", les journalistes du Monde Fabrice Lhomme et Gérard Davet racontent effectivement le locataire de l'Élysée comme peu avant eux, déclenchant de nouvelles polémiques.\n\n\nDans plus de 600 pages écrites à partir d'entretiens et de dîners notamment, les deux hommes tracent le portrait du président de la République, reviennent sur son mandat et sa vie privée pendant ses cinq ans aux commandes du pays. Surtout, ils assistent en privilégiés à un mandat particulièrement ardu. Tellement ardu qu'invité à \"On n'est pas couché\", Gérard Davet a eu une formule choc sur la présidence Hollande : \"Dès qu'il touche un truc, ça se transforme en emmerde\".\n\n\nDes SMS conservés par Valérie Trierweiler ?\n\n\nEt d'ajouter que malgré les nombreuses mesures prises au cours de son mandat, en particulier en matière sociale, \"les gens s'en foutent\". Un constat implacable. Comme le montre notre vidéo en tête d'article, les deux journalistes abordent également la relation entre François Hollande et son premier ministre Manuel Valls, expliquant qu'en dépit des apparences, les deux hommes partagent la même ligne, les mêmes convictions. \"Valls, c'est quelque part la face émergée de l'iceberg Hollande\", déclare ainsi Gérard Davet.\n\n\nAu cours de leur passage chez Laurent Ruquier, les journalistes sont également revenus sur l'une des polémiques du moment : le SMS attribué à François Hollande et dévoilé par son ancienne compagne Valérie Trierweiler sur Twitter. Ils racontent par exemple avoir dîné une fois avec l'ex-première dame, mais insistent surtout sur la crainte qu'en a désormais le président de la République. \"Ce que je ressens, c'est que François Hollande a toujours peur des réactions qu'elle pourrait avoir\", précise Gérard Davet. \"Je pense qu'il doit savoir savoir qu'elle conserve quelques dizaines de SMS.\" Et Fabrice Lhomme de conclure : \"Manifestement, il ne la connaissait pas assez bien.\"\n\n\n\nLire aussi :\n\n\n• Sarkozy, voile, immigration...

It’s horrific,” said Jake Sanchez, a public information officer for the California Highway Patrol. “There were people down below, and we have bodies that were, you know, they are innocent people that are just down here having a good time, and now they’re gone.”\n\nThe driver of the truck survived and was later charged with driving under the influence, authorities said. Sanchez said the 24-year-old driver is in the Navy, assigned to the North Island Naval Air Station on Coronado Island.\n\nStunned witnesses described the horror of seeing the truck crashing onto the festival gathering. \n\nThe truck “was going so fast it flew over the stage and landed in front of the stage on a tent,” Chase Dameron told the San Diego Union-Tribune. “It was like a movie. It was like in slow motion,” he added, describing the scene as “instant chaos and panic.”\n\n(Reporting by Marty Graham in San Diego and Chris Michaud in New York; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

C'est ce que le rap fran&ccedil;ais rappelle quand il s'attaque &agrave; la maltraitance rejoignant ainsi la mission r&eacute;galienne de la protection de l'enfance. <strong>DBRZ</strong> en 2014 raconte le v&eacute;cu d'un enfant maltrait&eacute; par son p&egrave;re dans<u> Mon Papa</u>. Derri&egrave;re l'apparente na&iuml;vet&eacute; du texte, c'est bien toute la probl&eacute;matique de la maltraitance qui se dessine. Comment un enfant peut il imaginer qu'on l'aime et le maltraite ? \"<em>Papa, dis moi, pourquoi tu me tapes l&agrave;?</em>\" puisque pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment, il ob&eacute;it &agrave; l'injonction de silence impos&eacute; \"<em>Chaque fois, tu sais, je ne parle pas</em>\". Coinc&eacute; entre l'envie d'&ecirc;tre appr&eacute;ci&eacute; de son p&egrave;re, d'ob&eacute;ir aux r&egrave;gles qu'il fixe et celle de cesser de souffrir autant, cet enfant h&eacute;site entre fuir et r&eacute;sister. Pourtant, il aimerait que cet adulte cens&eacute; le prot&eacute;ger le comprenne, l'entende dans sa souffrance. Quand les adultes ne nous prot&egrave;gent plus, qu'ils n'agissent plus comme des remparts face aux violences potentielles du monde, alors les enfants cherchent d'autres moyens. Mais se prot&eacute;ger de ceux qui sont cens&eacute;s le faire rel&egrave;ve d'un paradoxe si grand, qu'il en devient incompr&eacute;hensible et les rep&egrave;res se brouillent n&eacute;cessairement. \"<em>Tu sais mon lit m'sert de rempart/Je prie, je crie, toi tu... tu t'empares/D'autrui, ma vie t'appartient pas/ Papa, je ne pars pas.</em>\"</p>\n\n<p>L'objectif n'est pas seulement de faire pleurer dans les chaumi&egrave;res, mais aussi de faire r&eacute;agir, de faire entendre cette souffrance. Le groupe <strong>2 Bal 2 Neg</strong> dans <u>Que faire ?</u> en 1996 interrogeait aussi les possibles qui s'ouvrent ou non quand l'incompr&eacute;hension domine au sein de la cellule familiale :<em>\"Que faire, quand on est satur&eacute; par son p&egrave;re ou sa m&egrave;re ?/Il ne sait que faire.../Que faire, quand on pense que nos parents nous veulent que mis&egrave;re ?/Il ne sait que faire... \"</em> Le foss&eacute; g&eacute;n&eacute;rationnel existe, il ne peut &ecirc;tre compens&eacute; que par l'amour, celui que <strong>KDD</strong> dans <u>Le geste</u> en 2000 consid&egrave;re comme crucial : \"<em>Rien n'remplace le geste m&ecirc;me pas l'cadeau/Rien n'remplace l'amour m&ecirc;me pas l'geste/Gesticule dans c'monde prouve que tu existes/Sans amour dans l' c&oelig;ur, Y'a que les murs qui r&eacute;sistent\". </em>Cet amour suppose consid&eacute;ration, attention aux besoins et surtout respect de la diff&eacute;rence g&eacute;n&eacute;rationnelle qui fonde la perspective du temps, du devenir et donc de l'avenir. La maltraitance brise cette mise en perspective du sujet, comme l'&eacute;voque <strong>Yanis Odua</strong> dans <u>Une larme</u> en 2002 ou <strong>Nakk Mendosa</strong> en 2016 avec <u>Elodie</u>. En reprenant le point de vue d'une victime d'inceste, c'est la mani&egrave;re dont la violence sexuelle d&eacute;poss&egrave;de l'individu de son &ecirc;tre, de son corps qui interpelle. D'o&ugrave; le r&ecirc;ve de s'envoler pour ne plus ressentir la souffrance physique d'une part, mais aussi pour s'imaginer autre : \"<em>J'sais pas pour vous, moi j'aimerais m'envoler/Tu sais qu'c'est fou, mais j'aimerais m'envoler/J'sais pas pour vous, moi j'aimerais m'envoler/M'envoler sans traverser les volets/J'aimerais &ecirc;tre quelqu'un d'autre (X3)/Quelqu'un d'autre</em>\".</p>\n\n<p>De m&ecirc;me que DBRZ, ce que Nakk d&eacute;crit, c'est l'ambivalence face &agrave; la violence. L'enfant victime s'interroge toujours d'abord sur lui avant d'incriminer les autres. Elodie \"<em>Se pose des questions, mais tu sais elle /Trouve pas d'r&eacute;ponses, pas de QCM/Par la fen&ecirc;tre, elle visualise son avenir ou sa chute/Pourquoi sa m&egrave;re boit? Pourquoi son putain d'beau-p&egrave;re veut mettre sa main sous sa jupe ? Alors sa dr&ocirc;le d'adolescence, tout c'qu'elle peut faire, c'est l'enterrer/Elle a bien des pines-co, mais la plupart ont des centres d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t sans int&eacute;r&ecirc;t/Et dans ses r&ecirc;ves, non, elle ne r&ecirc;ve plus/Dans sa t&ecirc;te, putain, c'est l'vacarme/Elle voudrait une autre vie, une vie d'ado, t'sais/Avoir son mec, son Kev Adams/A cet &acirc;ge t'as des probl&egrave;mes, pas des solutions</em>\". <em>On n'est pas s&eacute;rieux quand on a 17 ans</em>, disait Rimbaud, sauf quand on est victime. Alors quelque chose de cette insouciance s'&eacute;chappe, quelque chose de l'enfance s'efface pour laisser place aux questions d'adultes auxquelles nul n'a de r&eacute;ponse. Impossible de se sentir accept&eacute; par ses pairs quand nos conditions d'existence nous obligent &agrave; vivre une vie qui n'est pas la leur. Alors on grandit plus vite, plus fort, moins bien que les autres, moins sereinement en tout cas, le futur n'est plus promesse, mais souvent chemin de croix. Cette conscience l&agrave;, Elodie l'a, mais personne ne la voit, pire personne ne la croit :\"<em>Et tu sais quoi? Apr&egrave;s une &eacute;ni&egrave;me gueule de bois/Sa m&egrave;re lui dit</em> : \"<em>j'suis comme St Thomas sauf que je n'crois que ce que je bois/Tu le crois &ccedil;a? Elodie en a marre, marre de mourir un peu tous les soirs\" (...) Dans la maison, elle a un secret, personne la croit, m&ecirc;me pas la Voix</em>\". Pour sortir de l'impasse encore faut-il &ecirc;tre entendu et le rap vient comme un t&eacute;moin de l'horreur, celui qui croit, qui d&eacute;fend, qui accueille l'insupportable. Nakk s'en fait le porte parole, pour que le silence cesse de tuer, de m&ecirc;me que <strong>Sir Samuel</strong> dans <u>Prendre le large</u> en 2011 qui revient tant sur les enfants soldats que sur la prostitution des mineurs &agrave; partir encore de leur point de vue.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"margin-left:27.0pt;\"><em>\"Je me pr&eacute;sente je n'ai que 8 ans,</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Je connais d&eacute;j&agrave; la guerre c'est mon travail,</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Assassiner vieillards, femmes, et enfants,</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Vous connaissez maintenant mon travail,</em></p>\n\n<p><em>J'insiste, j'aime jouer, et sourire &agrave; la vie,</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Mais pour moi la vie c'est mon travail,</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Et la plupart du temps je tire, et personne je n'&eacute;pargne.</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:27.0pt;\"><em>(....)</em></p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:27.0pt;\"><em>Je me pr&eacute;sente, je n'ai que 13ans, je connais d&eacute;j&agrave; mon corps c'est mon travail,</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Aguicher les hommes tout comme une femme c'est g&ecirc;nant,</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Je vous l'accorde mais c'est mon travail.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Fait vite de jouer ou de terrasser ma vie, tu sais que l&agrave; dehors</em></p>\n\n<p><em>J'ai du travail,</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Quand je sais ce qui m'attend j'n'arrive m&ecirc;me plus &agrave; fondre en larmes.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Je connais pas la paix, je connais que des hommes qui profitent de moi,</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Pleurer n'en vaut pas la peine, j'ai plus de haine que toi.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ce que ces titres r&eacute;v&egrave;lent de mani&egrave;re forte et sensible (au sens o&ugrave; ils touchent &agrave; la sensibilit&eacute; de chacun), c'est l'importance de la distinction entre adulte et enfant. Alors que notre soci&eacute;t&eacute; tend &agrave; effacer cette barri&egrave;re fondamentale, le Hip-Hop vient quelque part la rappeler avec sa force et sa virulence. Par d&eacute;finition un enfant est en construction et n'a pas encore tous les codes et rep&egrave;res qui lui permettront de respecter sa propre int&eacute;grit&eacute; et celle d'autrui. Ce sont aux adultes de les prot&eacute;ger et non de les exposer. D'o&ugrave; l'importance de d&eacute;noncer les maltraitances, les violences, les exactions sans r&eacute;pit par tous les moyens possibles, rap compris. Que ce soit celles qu'on vit individuellement ou celles des autres, l'enjeu est de dire, d'exprimer, de cesser de taire ce qui revient &agrave; jouer le jeu de la folie du moment. Pour cela, encore faut-il accepter de s'ouvrir, de s'exposer, de se donner &agrave; voir, ce qui est d'ailleurs le propre de l'art et de la d&eacute;marche artistique. Par l'expression rapologique, ce sont nos vuln&eacute;rabilit&eacute;s qui se disent et se croisent, les souffrances qui se rencontrent pour &ecirc;tre d&eacute;pass&eacute;es ensemble.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lire aussi :</strong></p>\n\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/01/18/le-rappeur-americain-clarence-reid-alias-blowfly-est-mort-a-lag/?utm_hp_ref=fr-hip-hop\">L'un des premiers rappeurs de l'histoire est mort</a></p>\n\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2015/08/05/vid-os-drake-will-smith-et-kanye-west-se-moquent-du-rappeur-me/?utm_hp_ref=fr-hip-hop\">Drake, Will Smith et Kanye West se moquent du rappeur Meek Mill</a></p>\n\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2015/06/06/vid-os-nekfeu-de-1995-sort-feu-un-premier-album-solo-et-s/?utm_hp_ref=fr-hip-hop\">La star du rap fran&ccedil;ais qui monte, c'est lui</a></p>\n\n<p>&bull;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr\" target=\"_hplink\"> Pour suivre les derni&egrave;res actualit&eacute;s en direct sur <em>Le HuffPost</em>, cliquez ici</a></p>\n\n<p>&bull;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/newsletter/france\" target=\"_hplink\"> Tous les matins, recevez gratuitement la newsletter du <em>HuffPost</em></a></p>\n\n<p>&bull;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LeHuffingtonPost\" target=\"_hplink\"> Retrouvez-nous sur notre page Facebook</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>&Agrave; voir &eacute;galement sur <em>Le HuffPost</em>:</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"355\" hspace=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.ultimedia.com/deliver/generic/iframe/mdtk/01590560/zone/1/showtitle/1/src/l5pkv5\" style=\"z-index:1;\" vspace=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"630\"></iframe></p>",

D'apr&egrave;s nos sources, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/10/13/trop-cest-trop-spectaculaire-discours-michelle-obama-contre-donald-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">le milliardaire</a> s'est plaint de l'allure de Kardashian et a tout fait pour l'&eacute;liminer.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>\"On peut m&ecirc;me pas avoir la bombasse de la famille?\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>\"Il voulait tout simplement la virer\", raconte l'un des monteurs. \"Il l'a trait&eacute;e de 'truie' et s'est exclam&eacute;: 'Qu'est-ce que c'est que &ccedil;a? On peut m&ecirc;me pas avoir la bombasse de la famille?' (une allusion &agrave; la s&oelig;ur de Khloe, Kim).</p>\n\n<p>Un autre membre de l'&eacute;quipe a confirm&eacute; la v&eacute;rit&eacute; de l'incident, et le vocabulaire employ&eacute;: \"Il a dit: 'Et si on virait Khloe? C'est une grosse truie. Pourquoi est-ce qu'on a h&eacute;rit&eacute; du boudin de la famille?'\"</p>\n\n<p>Une troisi&egrave;me source, qui travaillait elle aussi au montage, se souvient sp&eacute;cifiquement de cette &eacute;limination, parce que Donald Trump la prenait tr&egrave;s &agrave; c&oelig;ur. \"Quand ils l'ont vir&eacute;e, &ccedil;a n'avait rien &agrave; voir avec ses comp&eacute;tences\", explique-t- elle. \"C'est simplement parce qu'il ne l'aimait pas.\" Elle affirme que Donald Trump a demand&eacute; &agrave; l'&eacute;quipe de l'aider &agrave; trouver un motif pour l'&eacute;liminer.</p>\n\n<p>L'&eacute;quipe du candidat &agrave; la pr&eacute;sidentielle n'a pas souhait&eacute; commenter ces all&eacute;gations. Mais ses propos suppos&eacute;s sur Khloe Kardashian traduisent bien la grossi&egrave;ret&eacute; dont il &eacute;tait coutumier entre les prises de l'&eacute;mission. Il y a quelques jours, le <em>Huffington Post</em> a publi&eacute; la transcription d'une s&eacute;quence non diffus&eacute;e dans laquelle Donald Trump se moquait des probl&egrave;mes de peau d'une jeune chanteuse de country music. Jeudi 13 octobre, The Daily Beast a r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; qu'il avait qualifi&eacute; &agrave; plusieurs reprises l'actrice sourde Marlee Matlin de \"demeur&eacute;e\" quand elle participait &agrave; l'&eacute;mission.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Un homme \"misogyne et \"&eacute;gocentrique\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>D'autres monteurs de l'&eacute;mission de \"The Apprentice\" d&eacute;crivent un homme \"misogyne\" et \"&eacute;gocentrique\" qui n'arr&ecirc;tait pas de reluquer les candidates. Il cachait rarement la r&eacute;pugnance que lui inspiraient certaines, ajoutent plusieurs membres de l'&eacute;quipe. En ce qui concerne Khloe Kardashian, il a fallu chambouler toute l'&eacute;mission.<br />\n<br />\nD'apr&egrave;s une quatri&egrave;me source qui travaillait sur l'&eacute;mission, il a pr&eacute;tendu que son &eacute;limination &eacute;tait due au fait qu'elle devait retourner &agrave; Los Angeles afin de purger sa peine, suite &agrave; une arrestation pour conduite en &eacute;tat d'ivresse, et qu'il n'avait appris qu'au dernier moment qu'elle devait partir (notre source affirme pourtant que les contrats de la plupart des participants contenaient une clause leur permettant de s'absenter quelques jours).</p>\n\n<p>Pendant l'enregistrement, Donald Trump a critiqu&eacute; la jeune femme pour sa conduite, et fait allusion &agrave; l'alcoolisme de son propre fr&egrave;re, et &agrave; plusieurs amis qui avaient perdu des proches dans des accidents de la route li&eacute;s &agrave; l'alcool.</p>\n\n<div class=\"vdb_player vdb_5688f66de4b040e17d9912265688f5c1e4b0f2c97f395156\" vdb_params=\"m.refbcid=56000e19e4b0e4e194b84b31&amp;m.refpid=5668ae6ee4b0b5e26955d6a6\"><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=5688f66de4b040e17d991226/vid=5800371a76a6054acad7fe48/5688f5c1e4b0f2c97f395156.js\"></script></div>\n\n<p><strong>\"C'&eacute;tait vraiment n'importe quoi\"</strong></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>A l'&eacute;poque, Khloe Kardashian, dont l'agent n'a pas r&eacute;pondu &agrave; nos questions, avait exprim&eacute; sa stupeur d'avoir &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;limin&eacute;e. Les fid&egrave;les de l'&eacute;mission ont fait remarquer que, quelques ann&eacute;es auparavant, Donald Trump en avait fait des tonnes quand il avait \"pardonn&eacute;\" &agrave; Tara Conner, une Miss USA, d'avoir apparemment eu des probl&egrave;mes d'alcool et de substances prohib&eacute;es.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>\"C'&eacute;tait vraiment n'importe quoi\", poursuit notre source, &agrave; propos de l'&eacute;limination de Kardashian. \"Inventer ce truc tordu pour la virer... Compl&egrave;tement absurde.\"</p>\n\n<p>Des ann&eacute;es plus tard, Donald Trump s'est &eacute;galement f&acirc;ch&eacute; avec <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/news/kanye-west-kim-kardashian/\" target=\"_blank\">Kim Kardashian</a>: au cours d'une interview diffus&eacute;e dans l'&eacute;mission Showbiz Tonight de la cha&icirc;ne HLN, il s'est moqu&eacute; des kilos qu'elle avait pris quand elle &eacute;tait enceinte de sa fille North West: \"Elle est devenue un peu grosse.

    "plain_text": "\nÉTATS-UNIS - Plusieurs membres de l'équipe ont confirmé au Huffington Post américain que Donald Trump avait fait des remarques désobligeantes sur le poids de Khloe Kardashian avant de la virer de l'émission, lors de l'enregistrement d'un épisode de Celebrity Apprentice, en 2009.\n\n\nCes remarques ont été prononcées hors champ, avant la séquence principale au cours de laquelle les candidats les moins doués étaient remerciés d'un cinglant: \"You're fired!\" (\"Virée!\"). D'après nos sources, le milliardaire s'est plaint de l'allure de Kardashian et a tout fait pour l'éliminer.\n\n\n\n\"On peut même pas avoir la bombasse de la famille?\"\n\n\n\"Il voulait tout simplement la virer\", raconte l'un des monteurs. \"Il l'a traitée de 'truie' et s'est exclamé: 'Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça? On peut même pas avoir la bombasse de la famille?' (une allusion à la sœur de Khloe, Kim).\n\n\nUn autre membre de l'équipe a confirmé la vérité de l'incident, et le vocabulaire employé: \"Il a dit: 'Et si on virait Khloe? C'est une grosse truie. Pourquoi est-ce qu'on a hérité du boudin de la famille?'\"\n\n\nUne troisième source, qui travaillait elle aussi au montage, se souvient spécifiquement de cette élimination, parce que Donald Trump la prenait très à cœur. \"Quand ils l'ont virée, ça n'avait rien à voir avec ses compétences\", explique-t- elle. \"C'est simplement parce qu'il ne l'aimait pas.\" Elle affirme que Donald Trump a demandé à l'équipe de l'aider à trouver un motif pour l'éliminer.\n\n\nL'équipe du candidat à la présidentielle n'a pas souhaité commenter ces allégations. Mais ses propos supposés sur Khloe Kardashian traduisent bien la grossièreté dont il était coutumier entre les prises de l'émission. Il y a quelques jours, le Huffington Post a publié la transcription d'une séquence non diffusée dans laquelle Donald Trump se moquait des problèmes de peau d'une jeune chanteuse de country music. Jeudi 13 octobre, The Daily Beast a révélé qu'il avait qualifié à plusieurs reprises l'actrice sourde Marlee Matlin de \"demeurée\" quand elle participait à l'émission.\n\n\n\nUn homme \"misogyne et \"égocentrique\"\n\n\nD'autres monteurs de l'émission de \"The Apprentice\" décrivent un homme \"misogyne\" et \"égocentrique\" qui n'arrêtait pas de reluquer les candidates. Il cachait rarement la répugnance que lui inspiraient certaines, ajoutent plusieurs membres de l'équipe. En ce qui concerne Khloe Kardashian, il a fallu chambouler toute l'émission.\n\n\n\nD'après une quatrième source qui travaillait sur l'émission, il a prétendu que son élimination était due au fait qu'elle devait retourner à Los Angeles afin de purger sa peine, suite à une arrestation pour conduite en état d'ivresse, et qu'il n'avait appris qu'au dernier moment qu'elle devait partir (notre source affirme pourtant que les contrats de la plupart des participants contenaient une clause leur permettant de s'absenter quelques jours).\n\n\nPendant l'enregistrement, Donald Trump a critiqué la jeune femme pour sa conduite, et fait allusion à l'alcoolisme de son propre frère, et à plusieurs amis qui avaient perdu des proches dans des accidents de la route liés à l'alcool.\n\n\n\n\n\"C'était vraiment n'importe quoi\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA l'époque, Khloe Kardashian, dont l'agent n'a pas répondu à nos questions, avait exprimé sa stupeur d'avoir été éliminée. Les fidèles de l'émission ont fait remarquer que, quelques années auparavant, Donald Trump en avait fait des tonnes quand il avait \"pardonné\" à Tara Conner, une Miss USA, d'avoir apparemment eu des problèmes d'alcool et de substances prohibées.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"C'était vraiment n'importe quoi\", poursuit notre source, à propos de l'élimination de Kardashian. \"Inventer ce truc tordu pour la virer... Complètement absurde.\"\n\n\nDes années plus tard, Donald Trump s'est également fâché avec Kim Kardashian: au cours d'une interview diffusée dans l'émission Showbiz Tonight de la chaîne HLN, il s'est moqué des kilos qu'elle avait pris quand elle était enceinte de sa fille North West: \"Elle est devenue un peu grosse. Je dis juste qu'il faut qu'elle arrête de s'habiller comme si elle pesait encore 55 kilos.\"\n\n\n\nCet article a été publié à l'origine sur le Huffington Post américain et a été traduit par Alain Smiti pour Fast for Word.\n\n\n\nLire aussi :\n\n\n• Trump face à une vague d'accusations d'attouchements sexuels\n\n\n• Même le camp républicain ne se remet pas de la vidéo de Trump\n\n\n• Une vidéo d'un Trump obscène, tournée à son insu, soulève un gigantesque tollé\n\n\n• Pour suivre les dernières actualités en direct sur Le HuffPost, cliquez ici\n\n\n• Tous les matins, recevez gratuitement la newsletter du HuffPost\n\n\n• Retrouvez-nous sur notre page Facebook\n\n\n\nÀ voir également sur Le HuffPost:\n\n\n\n ",

Par une analyse visuelle de mon corps et parmi les deux seules cases au choix en France, on m'a attribu&eacute; un sexe administratif &agrave; la naissance, en l'occurence le sexe F. Notre soci&eacute;t&eacute; fonctionnant ainsi, ce sexe a automatiquement entra&icirc;n&eacute; un genre social dans lequel on m'a &eacute;lev&eacute; (pr&eacute;nom, accords au f&eacute;minin, v&ecirc;tements, activit&eacute;s...). Or il s'av&egrave;re que ce genre social qu'on m'a cr&eacute;&eacute; ne correspond pas avec mon genre psychologique (ce que je me ressens &ecirc;tre).</p>\n\n<p>Depuis plusieurs ann&eacute;es, je vis donc au quotidien avec un pr&eacute;nom et un genre social qui ne sont pas ceux avec lesquels j'ai commenc&eacute; ma vie. Par cons&eacute;quent, sur mes papiers, mon pr&eacute;nom et la mention de mon sexe sont erron&eacute;s.</p>\n\n<p><strong>En quoi &ccedil;a pose un probl&egrave;me ?</strong></p>\n\n<p>C'est vrai, ce ne sont que des papiers ! La pertinence de sa carte d'identit&eacute; ou de son passeport peut sembler une consid&eacute;ration bien futile face aux autres probl&eacute;matiques de la vie.</p>\n\n<p>Les relations en soci&eacute;t&eacute; sont pourtant constell&eacute;es de moments o&ugrave; il faut justifier ou exposer son identit&eacute; civile : trouver un emploi, prendre un logement, se faire soigner, retirer un colis, voter, r&eacute;pondre &agrave; un contr&ocirc;le des forces de l'ordre, payer ses imp&ocirc;ts, entrer dans un b&acirc;timent s&eacute;curis&eacute;... Pour une personne transgenre, chacun de ces moments se transforme au choix en un refus de service, un interrogatoire plein de suspicion ou dans le meilleur des cas en l'exposition de sa vie priv&eacute;e &agrave; des parfait&middot;e&middot;s inconnu&middot;e&middot;s. C'est stressant, usant, d&eacute;gradant.</p>\n\n<p>Avec des papiers d'identit&eacute; erron&eacute;s, tout devient plus complexe pour s'assurer une vie d&eacute;cente et l'acc&egrave;s &agrave; sa citoyennet&eacute;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Mais alors pourquoi tu ne changes pas tes papiers ?\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Je ne compte plus les fois o&ugrave; cette question m'a &eacute;t&eacute; pos&eacute;e. Si la d&eacute;marche &eacute;tait facile et &eacute;thique, bien entendu que je l'aurais faite !</p>\n\n<p>Actuellement, aucune loi n'encadre le changement de pr&eacute;nom et de la mention de son sexe. Cela se passe au Tribunal de Grande Instance o&ugrave; les crit&egrave;res d'acceptation ou de refus du juge sont laiss&eacute;s sans cadre. La pratique la plus courante est donc par exemple de demander la st&eacute;rilisation des personnes (sous couvert de formules telles que \"preuve de changements irr&eacute;versibles\"). Des expertises m&eacute;dicales sont &eacute;galement demand&eacute;es par certains tribunaux.</p>\n\n<p>Il s'agit donc pour les personnes transgenres d'exposer leur identit&eacute;, leur vie priv&eacute;e et parfois leur anatomie &agrave; une personne tierce qui d&eacute;cide seule si la demande est l&eacute;gitime et qui s'appuie bien souvent sur des st&eacute;r&eacute;otypes sexistes. Des refus ou des expertises d&eacute;favorables ont ainsi d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; rendus pour des motifs aussi farfelus que la taille de la poitrine d'une femme transgenre jug&eacute;e insuffisante ou parce qu'un homme transgenre s'&eacute;pilait les jambes.</p>\n\n<p>Si je n'ai pas chang&eacute; mes papiers c'est que, dans ma situation, j'estime mes chances d'obtenir une d&eacute;cision favorable quasi nulle et que l'id&eacute;e de pr&eacute;senter des documents m&eacute;dicaux &agrave; un juge m'est insupportable. Je sais qui je suis et mon identit&eacute; ne devrait n&eacute;cessiter la validation de personne.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Une avanc&eacute;e l&eacute;gislative ?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mercredi dernier, dans la derni&egrave;re lecture du projet de loi Justice du 21e si&egrave;cle, l'Assembl&eacute;e Nationale a apport&eacute; du nouveau dans les conditions d'acc&egrave;s &agrave; une identit&eacute; administrative correcte pour les personnes transgenres et intersexes.</p>\n\n<p>Sur le papier, il est pr&eacute;vu que les individus majeurs ou avec autorisation d'un responsable l&eacute;gal puissent demander la rectification de leur(s) pr&eacute;nom(s) sur simple d&eacute;claration aupr&egrave;s d'un officier d'&eacute;tat civil. Toutefois, cet officier peut saisir le Procureur de la R&eacute;publique s'il estime la demande non l&eacute;gitime. En cas de refus du Procureur, le juge aux affaire familiales doit &ecirc;tre saisi. Les motifs de refus ne sont pas d&eacute;finis par l'article de loi. Quand on conna&icirc;t les positions de certaines municipalit&eacute;s et les pratiques de nombreux procureurs, il est &agrave; pr&eacute;voir des diff&eacute;rences de traitement sur le territoire et des d&eacute;cisions \"&agrave; la t&ecirc;te du client\".</p>\n\n<p>Concernant le changement de la mention de sexe, le sort des personnes sera encore plus livr&eacute; &agrave; l'arbitraire car toujours d&eacute;termin&eacute; par le Tribunal de Grande Instance. Les articles de loi pr&eacute;voient des crit&egrave;res tr&egrave;s flous, bas&eacute;s sur l'apparence, la notori&eacute;t&eacute; et sur des documents de preuve non d&eacute;finis explicitement. La seule avanc&eacute;e non n&eacute;gligeable est l'&eacute;criture dans la loi que les crit&egrave;res m&eacute;dicaux ne peuvent suffire &agrave; motiver un refus. Reste &agrave; savoir comment cela se d&eacute;roulera dans les faits...</p>\n\n<p>Le texte de loi nouvellement vot&eacute; se r&eacute;v&egrave;le donc &ecirc;tre une d&eacute;ception par rapport aux revendications des personnes concern&eacute;es qui r&eacute;clament un changement d'&eacute;tat civil d&eacute;judiciaris&eacute;, non soumis &agrave; des conditions m&eacute;dicales, sur simple d&eacute;claration en mairie. Il est important de noter que le Conseil de l'Europe a par deux fois &eacute;mis une recommandation allant en ce sens et que de plus en plus de pays europ&eacute;ens font le choix d'un vrai progr&egrave;s.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pourquoi ce choix soci&eacute;tal ?</strong></p>\n\n<p>La question sous-jacente &agrave; cette situation est celle de la structuration de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; autour de deux cases herm&eacute;tiques qui s'opposent : m&acirc;le / femelle, homme / femme, masculin / f&eacute;minin. Qui cette structuration sert-elle ? Difficile de ne pas y voir une volont&eacute; collective, sans doute inconsciente, de contr&ocirc;ler ce que sont les gens et ce qui leur est autoris&eacute; socialement ou l&eacute;galement en fonction de leur sexe.</p>\n\n<p>Les scientifiques le savent d&eacute;j&agrave; depuis longtemps, en mati&egrave;re de sexuation, la biologie des corps humains ne se r&eacute;sume pas &agrave; deux extr&ecirc;mes s&eacute;par&eacute;s par un vide. Tout un nuancier de variations existe. Pourquoi alors choisir un mod&egrave;le de soci&eacute;t&eacute; o&ugrave; une personne sera &eacute;tiquet&eacute;e par la forme de ses organes g&eacute;nitaux et risquera d'&ecirc;tre mutil&eacute;e chirurgicalement si ceux-ci ne sont pas conformes &agrave; l'ordre &eacute;tabli ?</p>\n\n<p>Pourquoi ensuite faire d&eacute;couler de cela un genre administratif ? Quelle utilit&eacute; r&eacute;elle a-t-il ? Classons-nous les gens en gauchers et droitiers &agrave; l'&eacute;tat civil ? Je rejoins l'id&eacute;e d'un grand classique des slogans de manifestations : \"Veuillez retirer votre sexe de mon &eacute;tat civil\".</p>\n\n<p>Enfin, la r&eacute;alit&eacute; montre qu'il existe une incroyable diversit&eacute; d'identit&eacute;s de genre, se pla&ccedil;ant ou non dans le spectre binaire homme / femme. Cette diversit&eacute; est l&agrave; et n'a attendu personne pour exister et s'exprimer. Que pensons-nous gagner &agrave; l'ignorer ?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ce samedi, je marcherai aupr&egrave;s des autres militant&middot;e&middot;s pour d&eacute;fendre l'id&eacute;e simple que c'est &agrave; l'&Eacute;tat et &agrave; la soci&eacute;t&eacute; de s'adapter &agrave; la diversit&eacute; des citoyen&middot;ne&middot;s et non l'inverse.</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Lire aussi :</strong></p>\n\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/xavier-delucq/le-pape-critique-les-manuels-scolaires-francais/?utm_hp_ref=fr-transgenre\">Le Pape critique les manuels scolaires fran&ccedil;ais</a></p>\n\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/09/27/modern-family-saison-8-le-premier-enfant-trans-a-jouer-dans-u/?utm_hp_ref=fr-transgenre\">Le premier enfant trans &agrave; jouer dans une s&eacute;rie am&eacute;ricaine</a></p>\n\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2016/09/19/le-discours-poignant-de-jeffrey-tambor-pour-les-acteurs-transgen/?utm_hp_ref=fr-transgenre\">Le discours poignant de Jeffrey Tambor pour les acteurs transgenres</a></p>\n\n<p>&bull;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/cest-la-vie/\" target=\"_hplink\"> Pour suivre les derni&egrave;res actualit&eacute;s en direct sur <em>Le HuffPost C'est La Vie</em>, cliquez ici</a></p>\n\n<p>&bull;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/newsletter/france-cest-la-vie\" target=\"_hplink\"> Deux fois par semaine, recevez gratuitement la newsletter du <em>HuffPost C'est La Vie</em></a></p>\n\n<p>&bull;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HuffPostCestlaVie?ref=hl\" target=\"_hplink\"> Retrouvez-nous sur notre page Facebook</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>&Agrave; voir &eacute;galement sur <em>Le HuffPost</em>:</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"355\" hspace=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.ultimedia.com/deliver/generic/iframe/mdtk/01590560/zone/1/showtitle/1/src/u3ppu0\" style=\"z-index:1;\" vspace=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"630\"></iframe></p>",

À la source des revendications, celles de la libre disposition de son corps et de l'auto-détermination de son identité.\n\n\nAujourd'hui en 2016 en France, je vis tous les jours avec des papiers d'identité qui ne traduisent pas mon identité réelle. À l'heure de la panique sécuritaire anti-terroriste, comment ce tour de passe-passe est-il possible avec la bénédiction de l'État et de ses administrations ?\n\n\nJe suis tout simplement une personne transgenre. Par une analyse visuelle de mon corps et parmi les deux seules cases au choix en France, on m'a attribué un sexe administratif à la naissance, en l'occurence le sexe F. Notre société fonctionnant ainsi, ce sexe a automatiquement entraîné un genre social dans lequel on m'a élevé (prénom, accords au féminin, vêtements, activités...). Or il s'avère que ce genre social qu'on m'a créé ne correspond pas avec mon genre psychologique (ce que je me ressens être).\n\n\nDepuis plusieurs années, je vis donc au quotidien avec un prénom et un genre social qui ne sont pas ceux avec lesquels j'ai commencé ma vie. Par conséquent, sur mes papiers, mon prénom et la mention de mon sexe sont erronés.\n\n\nEn quoi ça pose un problème ?\n\n\nC'est vrai, ce ne sont que des papiers ! La pertinence de sa carte d'identité ou de son passeport peut sembler une considération bien futile face aux autres problématiques de la vie.\n\n\nLes relations en société sont pourtant constellées de moments où il faut justifier ou exposer son identité civile : trouver un emploi, prendre un logement, se faire soigner, retirer un colis, voter, répondre à un contrôle des forces de l'ordre, payer ses impôts, entrer dans un bâtiment sécurisé... Pour une personne transgenre, chacun de ces moments se transforme au choix en un refus de service, un interrogatoire plein de suspicion ou dans le meilleur des cas en l'exposition de sa vie privée à des parfait·e·s inconnu·e·s. C'est stressant, usant, dégradant.\n\n\nAvec des papiers d'identité erronés, tout devient plus complexe pour s'assurer une vie décente et l'accès à sa citoyenneté.\n\n\n\"Mais alors pourquoi tu ne changes pas tes papiers ?\"\n\n\nJe ne compte plus les fois où cette question m'a été posée.

Toutefois, cet officier peut saisir le Procureur de la République s'il estime la demande non légitime. En cas de refus du Procureur, le juge aux affaire familiales doit être saisi. Les motifs de refus ne sont pas définis par l'article de loi. Quand on connaît les positions de certaines municipalités et les pratiques de nombreux procureurs, il est à prévoir des différences de traitement sur le territoire et des décisions \"à la tête du client\".\n\n\nConcernant le changement de la mention de sexe, le sort des personnes sera encore plus livré à l'arbitraire car toujours déterminé par le Tribunal de Grande Instance.

Quelle utilité réelle a-t-il ? Classons-nous les gens en gauchers et droitiers à l'état civil ?

L'&eacute;l&egrave;ve doit &ecirc;tre capable de \"comprendre les composantes biologiques principales de l'&eacute;tat masculin ou f&eacute;minin, du lien entre la sexualit&eacute; et la procr&eacute;ation et des relations entre la sexualit&eacute; et le plaisir. [...] Il s'agit d'aider l'&eacute;l&egrave;ve &agrave; la prise en charge responsable de sa vie sexuelle.\"</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Une notion est mise en avant, \"Devenir homme ou femme\", <a href=\"http://cache.media.education.gouv.fr/file/special_9/21/9/SVT_155219.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">pr&eacute;cisent encore</a> <a href=\"http://cache.media.education.gouv.fr/file/special_9/21/5/sciences_155215.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">les programmes</a>. \"On saisira l'occasion d'affirmer que si l'identit&eacute; sexuelle et les r&ocirc;les sexuels dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute; avec leurs st&eacute;r&eacute;otypes appartiennent &agrave; la sph&egrave;re publique, l'orientation sexuelle fait partie, elle, de la sph&egrave;re priv&eacute;e. Cette distinction conduit &agrave; porter l'attention sur les ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes biologiques concern&eacute;s\". Voil&agrave;, c'est ici que le b&acirc;t blesse. \"Ce th&egrave;me vise &agrave; fournir &agrave; l'&eacute;l&egrave;ve des connaissances scientifiques clairement &eacute;tablies, qui ne laissent de place ni aux informations erron&eacute;es sur le fonctionnement de son corps ni aux pr&eacute;jug&eacute;s.\"</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>\"D&egrave;s qu'on parle du vivant, c'est la m&ecirc;me difficult&eacute;\"</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\"Il est &eacute;vident qu'il faut choisir le bon moment dans l'ann&eacute;e pour aborder ce chapitre.

L'enseignante qui est aussi <a href=\"http://www.snes.edu/_Valerie-Sipahimalani_.html\" target=\"_blank\">secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;rale adjointe du SNES</a> a bien conscience d'&ecirc;tre, \"quelle que soit la classe, face &agrave; des &eacute;l&egrave;ves fragiles.

Jamais, n'ont-elles eu &agrave; d&eacute;plorer un d&eacute;bordement. \"Le plus important, c'est de pr&eacute;senter des connaissances scientifiques, des &eacute;l&eacute;ments de r&eacute;flexion vid&eacute;s de tout affect\", rappelle Val&eacute;rie Sipahimalani.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Dans les trois s&eacute;ries, le chapitre commence par comprendre comment se met en place l'appareil reproducteur puis son fonctionnement et les diff&eacute;rences entre homme et femme. \"Une fois que ces notions sont comprises, on peut passer &agrave; l'identit&eacute; sexuelle et &agrave; la distinction d'avec les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences sexuelles\", d&eacute;veloppe Lise Schroun. \"C'est le moment d'expliquer par exemple que <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/week-end/article/2011/04/08/l-homosexualite-n-est-pas-un-choix_1504178_1477893.html\" target=\"_blank\">l'orientation sexuelle n'est pas un choix</a>, pr&eacute;cise en Val&eacute;rie Sipahimalani, ainsi que la diff&eacute;rence entre le sexe biologique et le genre.\"</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Pas d'effet Manif pour tous</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Des notions qui r&eacute;sonnent chez les &eacute;l&egrave;ves et qui peuvent entra&icirc;ner des d&eacute;bats int&eacute;ressants. \"Parfois, je les laisse parler entre eux. Le travail de l'enseignant se situe entre la construction de la connaissance et le dialogue.

    "plain_text": "\nMANIF POUR TOUS - Mais que se passe-t-il vraiment dans les cours de Sciences de la vie et de la Terre? À écouter la Manif pour tous qui défile ce dimanche 16 octobre, la soi-disant \"théorie du genre\" y est enseignée. Au début du mois d'octobre 2016, le Pape François déplorait que cet enseignement était \"contre les choses naturelles\" craignant que les élèves français veuillent changer de sexe.\n\n\nUn niveau en particulier est visé, la classe de première des séries L, ES et S. Mais cette peinture des cours de SVT est bien éloignée de ce qui se passe vraiment en salle de classe. Un enseignant, Thomas Brissaire, s'en offusquait d'ailleurs sur Twitter en réponse au Pape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEn revanche on enseigne que oui un contexte culturel au delà des facteurs affectifs/cognitifs a une influence le comportement sexuel humain.\n— Thomas Brissaire (@tbrissaire) 3 octobre 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLe HuffPost a interrogé deux enseignantes de SVT qui enseignent au lycée Jules Ferry à Paris, Valérie Sipahimani et Lise Schroun, pour qu'elles nous racontent elles aussi l'envers du décor. Au programme, une transmission de connaissances scientifiques et, dans le meilleur des cas, des débats enrichissants entre élèves.\n\n\nDans les textes officiels, voici comment cette partie du programme est présentée. Parmi tous les thèmes étudiés au cours de l'année en S, ES et L, les élèves sont invités à se pencher sur la thématique \"féminin-masculin\". Son but est simple et commun à toutes les séries, \"étudier la sexualité humaine\" pour éduquer \"à la santé et à la responsabilité\". L'élève doit être capable de \"comprendre les composantes biologiques principales de l'état masculin ou féminin, du lien entre la sexualité et la procréation et des relations entre la sexualité et le plaisir. [...] Il s'agit d'aider l'élève à la prise en charge responsable de sa vie sexuelle.\"\n\n\nUne notion est mise en avant, \"Devenir homme ou femme\", précisent encore les programmes. \"On saisira l'occasion d'affirmer que si l'identité sexuelle et les rôles sexuels dans la société avec leurs stéréotypes appartiennent à la sphère publique, l'orientation sexuelle fait partie, elle, de la sphère privée. Cette distinction conduit à porter l'attention sur les phénomènes biologiques concernés\". Voilà, c'est ici que le bât blesse. \"Ce thème vise à fournir à l'élève des connaissances scientifiques clairement établies, qui ne laissent de place ni aux informations erronées sur le fonctionnement de son corps ni aux préjugés.\"\n\n\n\"Dès qu'on parle du vivant, c'est la même difficulté\"\n\n\n\"Il est évident qu'il faut choisir le bon moment dans l'année pour aborder ce chapitre. Ce ne sont pas des cours que je vais faire au début du mois de septembre. Il faut que la relation de confiance soit établie avec la classe\", commence Valérie Sipahimalani. L'enseignante qui est aussi secrétaire générale adjointe du SNES a bien conscience d'être, \"quelle que soit la classe, face à des élèves fragiles. Dès qu'on parle du vivant, c'est la même difficulté.\"\n\n\nLise Schroun, qui a suivi des formations données par des scientifiques sur ces thématiques en particulier, n'hésite pas à commencer par un propos introductif pour revenir sur la polémique. \"Contrairement à ce qu'on entend, on n'enseigne pas la 'théorie du genre'\", rappelle-t-elle en début de chapitre, précisant que cette partie du programme est celle qu'elle préfère enseigner.\n\n\n\"Des éléments de réflexion vidés de tout affect\"\n\n\nLes élèves de ces deux enseignantes, en particulier ceux qui suivent la filière scientifique, se montrent généralement \"intéressés\" par ces questions. Jamais, n'ont-elles eu à déplorer un débordement. \"Le plus important, c'est de présenter des connaissances scientifiques, des éléments de réflexion vidés de tout affect\", rappelle Valérie Sipahimalani.\n\n\nDans les trois séries, le chapitre commence par comprendre comment se met en place l'appareil reproducteur puis son fonctionnement et les différences entre homme et femme. \"Une fois que ces notions sont comprises, on peut passer à l'identité sexuelle et à la distinction d'avec les préférences sexuelles\", développe Lise Schroun. \"C'est le moment d'expliquer par exemple que l'orientation sexuelle n'est pas un choix, précise en Valérie Sipahimalani, ainsi que la différence entre le sexe biologique et le genre.\"\n\n\nPas d'effet Manif pour tous\n\n\nDes notions qui résonnent chez les élèves et qui peuvent entraîner des débats intéressants. \"Parfois, je les laissent parler entre eux. Le travail de l'enseignant se situe entre la construction de la connaissance et le dialogue. Ils peuvent ainsi se corriger entre eux et j'interviens si nécessaire\", analyse la secrétaire générale adjointe du SNES.\n\n\nDans la classe de Lise Schroun, cette thématique ne soulève pas plus de débats que les autres thèmes du programme. \"Peut-être sont-ils gênés, peut-être s'autocensurent-ils ou peut-être sont-ils simplement peu intéressés\", se questionne-t-elle.\n\n\nUne chose est sûre, elles n'ont pas ressentie un \"effet Manif pour tous\" ou une crispation dans leurs classes depuis que ce mouvement a émergé en 2012.\n\n\n\nLire aussi :\n\n\n•Que le pape se rassure, la théorie du genre n'existe pas et les enfants ne veulent pas changer de sexe à cause de l'école\n\n\n•La \"théorie du genre\" pour les nuls\n\n\n• Pour suivre les dernières actualités sur Le HuffPost C'est La Vie, cliquez ici\n\n\n• Deux fois par semaine, recevez la newsletter du HuffPost C'est La Vie\n\n\n• Retrouvez-nous sur notre page Facebook\n\n\n\nÀ voir également sur Le HuffPost:\n\n",

Une fois l'émission \"Touche pas à mon poste\" lancée, Cyril Hanouna est revenu sur les proportions prises par l'affaire, comme vous pouvez le voir dans la vidéo ci-dessus. \"C'est vrai que c'est fou pour pas grand chose\", a-t-il déclaré, précisant ensuite qu'il trouvait le geste \"regrettable\" et ne l'aurait pas fait.\n\n\n\nJean-Michel Maire a quant à lui essayé de minimiser son geste, précisant que c'était \"un bisou sur le haut du décolleté\" et non du sein, avant d'expliquer qu'il en avait discuté avec la jeune femme et qu'elle avait ri de l'incident. \"Vous auriez pu faire le front\", a suggéré Cyril Hanouna. Ou lui demander son avis.\n\n\n\nLire aussi :\n\n\n\n• Après 14h de direct, Cyril Hanouna s'accorde une sieste\n\n\n• Cyril Hanouna commence ses 35 heures de show... en perdant une dent\n\n\n• 35h de direct pour Hanouna ?

    "plain_text": "\nMÉDIAS - Alors que son arrivée sur l'antenne d'iTélé approche à grands pas, la bataille continue entre la rédaction de la chaîne et le groupe Canal + autour de Jean Marc Morandini. Après une motion de censure votée à l'écrasante majorité contre la direction de la chaîne et un affrontement par tribunes interposées, voici que le psychodrame qui secoue iTélé se retrouve sur les réseaux sociaux.\n\n\nAlors que la SDJ de la chaîne se démène depuis plusieurs jours pour empêcher la venue de l'animateur mis en examen pour \"corruption de mineur\", les journalistes ont reçu, samedi 15 octobre, l'appui de de leurs confrères ainsi que de nombreux internautes sur Twitter. Le hashtag #JeSoutiensItele s'est retrouvé en tête des sujets les plus discutés sur le réseau social en France.\n\n\n\n\nUne rédaction formidable. Des journalistes pro et dévoués. Une situation ubuesque. #JesoutiensITELE\n— Léa Salamé (@LeaSalame) 15 octobre 2016\n\n\n\n\n#jesoutiensITELE parce que notre métier meurt de tous ces combats non menés à cause de la peur. Soutien inconditionnel aux ex collègues.\n— Nassira El Moaddem (@NassiraELM) 15 octobre 2016\n\n\n\n\nDans ces circonstances, il n'est plus question de concurrence.#jesoutiensITELE\n— François Gapihan (@francoisgapihan) 15 octobre 2016\n\n\n\n\nPensées fortes aux confrères d'iTélé. Une belle rédaction. Des journalistes qui veulent juste faire leur travail #jesoutiensITELE\n— Aurélie Casse (@AureCasse) 15 octobre 2016\n\n\n\n\nPourquoi des journalistes devraient renoncer à leur emploi en raison d'un confrère embarrassant ? #JeSoutiensiTélé\n— Christophe Conte (@christopheconte) 15 octobre 2016\n\n\n\n\nVincent bolloré le cancer de Canal + qui recrute Morandini et Zemmour. Tellement affligeant et deplorable #JeSoutiensITELE\n— ZzZz (@Extrasenseur) 15 octobre 2016\n\n\n\n\n#jesoutiensITELE naturellement et toute la rédac dans son combat contre certains recrutements très douteux.\n— chantal simonato (@chantalsimonato) 15 octobre 2016\n\n\n\n\nMais, comme depuis le début de la grogne des journalistes, la direction de Canal + n'a pas tardé à réagir. En réponse à cette mobilisation, le compte officiel du groupe a publié un tweet - un brin provocateur - avec le hashtag #JeSoutiensLaPrésomptiondInnocence.\n\n\n\n\n#JeSoutiensLaPrésomptiondInnocence\n— Groupe CANAL+ (@canalplusgroupe) 15 octobre 2016\n\n\n\n\nUn message qui n'a pas connu la même résonance que les mots de soutien aux journalistes d'iTélé. Seul retweet marquant, celui de Jean Marc Morandini lui-même.\n\n\n\n\nRT #JeSoutiensLaPrésomptiondInnocence https://t.co/uiRfNb09bs\n— Jean Marc Morandini (@morandiniblog) 15 octobre 2016\n\n\n\n\n\nLire aussi :\n\n\n• Morandini répond aux journalistes\n\n\n• Les journalistes de iTELE demandent à Morandini \"de ne pas venir\"\n\n\n• Canal Plus confirme l'arrivée de Jean-Marc Morandini sur iTELE\n\n\n• Pour suivre les dernières actualités en direct sur Le HuffPost, cliquez ici\n\n\n• Tous les matins, recevez gratuitement la newsletter du HuffPost\n\n\n• Retrouvez-nous sur notre page Facebook\n\n\n\nÀ voir également sur Le HuffPost:\n\n\n\n ",
