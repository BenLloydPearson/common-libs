Brian Faler: \"House Republicans have said for years they want to reform the tax code and now, after much debate, they finally have a consensus plan. <b>GOP lawmakers are set Friday to unveil a tax code rewrite that substantially differs from ideas they've previously put forward, one that will call for a much deeper cut in the corporate tax rate — to 20 percent from 35 percent</b>. At the same time, Republicans are backing off plans to slash the top individual tax rate. <B>They’re settling for a top rate of 33 percent, not 25 percent</b> as they’ve long proposed. The current top rate is 39.6 percent. And they want to push the code closer to a consumption-style tax, where the government focuses more on taxing the money people spend, rather than what they earn. 'Our blueprint will deliver a tax code built for growth — the growth of jobs, the growth of paychecks and the growth of our economy,' said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady.\" [<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/house-republicans-tax-reform-224749#ixzz4CWq0KIKQ \" target=\"_hplink\">Politico</a>] \r\n\r\n<i>“We have a fairly high level of confidence that Mr. Trump will support a majority of these provisions,\" a House Republican leadership aide told Politico.

Trump arrived in Turnberry, Scotland on Friday to officially open his golf resort there and quickly embarrassed himself by tweeting that Scots were 'going wild' over Britain’s decision to leave the EU. The majority of Scotland had voted to remain. Asked about the uncertainty of the pound, Trump responded by pointing out how he stood to benefit from a weaker currency. It’s not the first time Trump has boasted about profiting off a weak economy. <STRONG>'If the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry, frankly,' he said at a press conference</STRONG>. 'For traveling and for other things, I think it very well could turn out to be positive.'\" [<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-brexit-profit_us_576d40d5e4b0f1683239401c?gu348lgpksjjrlik9\" target=\"_hplink\">HuffPost</a>] \r\n<i>In addition to having signed a nondisclosure agreement that probably also contains a non-disparagement clause, newly-hired CNN commentator Corey Lewandowski also relies on Donald Trump to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/06/24/another-conflict-of-interest-for-cnns-corey-lewandowski/\" target=\"_hplink\">pay his legal bills</a>.

At about 1 a.m. Eastern time, about eight hours after the polls closed, Google reported that searches for 'what happens if we leave the EU' had more than tripled...But despite the all-out attempts by either side to court voters, Britons were not only mystified by what would happen if they left the E.U.— many seemed not to even know what the European Union is.\" [<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/06/24/the-british-are-frantically-googling-what-the-eu-is-hours-after-voting-to-leave-it/?campaign_id=A100&campaign_type=Email\" target=\"_hplink\">WaPo</a>] \r\n\r\n<STRONG>Obama's statement</strong>: \"The people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision,” Obama said in a statement. “The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring, and the United Kingdom’s membership in NATO remains a vital cornerstone of U.S. foreign, security, and economic policy.

      "plain_text": "The world stands on the brink of economic catastrophe but it’s ok because a few more tourists from Phoenix are going to buy Titleist polos at the Turnery pro shop. With Britain now a free agent, the world eagerly waits to see if the Organization of American States will make a ten-year offer, with a trade deal to be named later.  And House Republicans introduced their tax agenda, which is now the second development this week that will likely end with a lot more of us seeking the warmth of oil drum fires. This is HUFFPOST HILL for Friday, June 24th, 2016:\r\n\r\nHOUSE GOP UNVEILS TAX PLAN - Because rich people are struggling more than ever and the death tax has got to go. Brian Faler: \"House Republicans have said for years they want to reform the tax code and now, after much debate, they finally have a consensus plan. GOP lawmakers are set Friday to unveil a tax code rewrite that substantially differs from ideas they've previously put forward, one that will call for a much deeper cut in the corporate tax rate — to 20 percent from 35 percent. At the same time, Republicans are backing off plans to slash the top individual tax rate. They’re settling for a top rate of 33 percent, not 25 percent as they’ve long proposed. The current top rate is 39.6 percent. And they want to push the code closer to a consumption-style tax, where the government focuses more on taxing the money people spend, rather than what they earn. 'Our blueprint will deliver a tax code built for growth — the growth of jobs, the growth of paychecks and the growth of our economy,' said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady.\" [Politico] \r\n\r\n“We have a fairly high level of confidence that Mr. Trump will support a majority of these provisions,\" a House Republican leadership aide told Politico. Good to keep a fairly high level of anonymity for that one.\r\n\r\nThe tax policy blueprint suggests eliminating itemized deductions! Oh except for charitable contributions and mortgage interest -- those benefit the rich. And it would eliminate the estate tax. \"As a political document, the plan seems tone-deaf. At a time when populist fever is running high, Ryan is proposing significant tax cuts for big business and investors, and much more modest tax cuts for middle-income households,\" the Tax Policy Center's Howard Gleckman said in a blog post. \r\n\r\nBeto O'Rourke (D-Texas) joined the HuffPost Politics Podcast this week, talked about how Dems hope their gun sit-in changed something even though nothing changed.\r\n\r\nRNC DELEGATES MAKING ONE LAST ANTI-TRUMP EFFORT - Kyle Cheney: \"Anti-Trump delegates to the Republican National Convention are circulating the language of a plan that would free all delegates to vote for the candidate of their choosing at the convention, a move aimed at loosening Donald Trump’s grip on the party’s presidential nomination. A letter, sent to members of the convention rules committee by Colorado delegate Kendal Unruh, makes no mention of Trump but includes a new party rule that would permit any delegate to shrug off pledged support — usually, support dictated by the results of state primaries or caucuses — for any candidate by invoking a new 'conscience' clause.\" [Politico]   \r\n\r\nDELANEY DOWNER - It's dumb to freak out about stocks, but photos of sad brokers are just so compelling, right? And besides, this part of the newsletter is about stuff goin' DOWN.  \"U.S. stocks plunged at the open on Friday, with the Dow Jones average falling more than 500 points, after Britain’s vote to quit the European Union delivered the biggest blow to the global financial system since the 2008 financial crisis. Investors worried about the outlook for the world economy sought refuge in the dollar and other safe-harbor assets such as gold and U.S. Treasury bonds, while dumping riskier shares. The yield on the U.S. 10-year bond hit its lowest since 2012.\" [Reuters] \r\n\r\nLike HuffPost Hill?

Trump arrived in Turnberry, Scotland on Friday to officially open his golf resort there and quickly embarrassed himself by tweeting that Scots were 'going wild' over Britain’s decision to leave the EU. The majority of Scotland had voted to remain. Asked about the uncertainty of the pound, Trump responded by pointing out how he stood to benefit from a weaker currency. It’s not the first time Trump has boasted about profiting off a weak economy. 'If the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry, frankly,' he said at a press conference. 'For traveling and for other things, I think it very well could turn out to be positive.'\" [HuffPost] \r\nIn addition to having signed a nondisclosure agreement that probably also contains a non-disparagement clause, newly-hired CNN commentator Corey Lewandowski also relies on Donald Trump to pay his legal bills. You suck, CNN.\r\n\r\nToo little, too late: \"That confusion over what Brexit might mean for the country's economy appears to have been reflected across the United Kingdom on Thursday. Google reported sharp upticks in searches not only related to the ballot measure but also about basic questions concerning the implications of the vote. At about 1 a.m. Eastern time, about eight hours after the polls closed, Google reported that searches for 'what happens if we leave the EU' had more than tripled...But despite the all-out attempts by either side to court voters, Britons were not only mystified by what would happen if they left the E.U.— many seemed not to even know what the European Union is.\" [WaPo] \r\n\r\nObama's statement: \"The people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision,” Obama said in a statement. “The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring, and the United Kingdom’s membership in NATO remains a vital cornerstone of U.S. foreign, security, and economic policy. So too is our relationship with the European Union, which has done so much to promote stability, stimulate economic growth, and foster the spread of democratic values and ideals across the continent and beyond.”\r\n\r\nGOP RESPONDS TO BREXIT - \"House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) sounded a more cautious note, saying he respects the choice of the United Kingdom’s electorate but maintained Friday that its exit will have no impact on America’s 'special relationship' with the country...Like Ryan, New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte said she respects the U.K.’s decision, declining to paint with a broader brush. 'I think that each country, including our own, we should be able to decide our own destiny. So it was for the people of Great Britain to decide if they wanted to be part of the European Union,' she told NH1..But other Republicans appeared to align more with Trump’s celebratory tone than Ryan’s diplomatic approach. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin congratulated the 'smart Brits' who knew it was time to leave the European Union, adding that now is America’s time...Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the first U.S. senator to endorse the real estate mogul, applauded the 'wake-up call' and signaled that it was America’s turn.\" [Politico] \r\n\r\nCOMPROMISE GUN BILL INTRODUCED IN HOUSE - Lindsey McPherson: \"Three House Republicans and one Democrat announced Friday the introduction of legislation to prevent individuals on certain terrorist watch lists from purchasing a gun but with an appeals process for denials. The bill, identical to a proposal Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins offered in the upper chamber , is part of a bipartisan, bicameral attempt to find a legislative compromise on restricting terrorists' access to guns following the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, this month that left 49 people dead and 53 others injured.The measure would impose restrictions on gun purchases by people on the no-fly and selectee lists but not the broader consolidated terrorist watch list.\" [Roll Call] \r\n\r\nGOP MEGADONOR WANTS GOVERNMENT HANDOUT - Travis Walldon: \"The NHL announced this week that its owners had approved an expansion franchise in Las Vegas, bringing professional sports to the city for the first time. Now, Republican mega-donor and casino mogul Sheldon Adelson wants to bring an NFL team to Vegas too — and he wants $750 million in taxpayer money to make it happen. The $750 million, financed with municipal bonds that would be paid off by hotel taxes, would go toward a new domed football stadium Adelson and a development group have proposed, according to Bloomberg. That figure would surpass the $620 million Indianapolis spent on a new stadium for the Colts, making it the biggest public contribution toward a stadium in American history, based on figures compiled last year by the Taxpayer Protection Alliance.\" [HuffPost] \r\n\r\nBECAUSE YOU'VE READ THIS FAR - Here's the child of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson \r\n\r\nSTONEWALL INN TO GET ITS DUE - As if Manhattan nightlife spots weren't crowded enough. Kate Sheppard: \"President Barack Obama will officially designate a new national monument at the site of the Stonewall uprising to honor the struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights in the United States, the White House announced Friday.  Patrons of the Stonewall Inn, a gay club in New York City, fought back against harassment and police raids in June 1969, sparking other riots and protests against the criminalization of homosexuality. Stonewall will be the first site in the National Park Service that recognizes the struggle for LGBT rights.\" [HuffPost] \r\n\r\nCOMFORT FOOD\r\n\r\n- How to brush your teeth. \r\n\r\n- Behold the glory of Japanese wrestling. \r\n\r\n- Llama really enjoys leaf blowers. \r\n\r\nTWITTERAMA\r\n\r\n@LOLGOP: Have you ever been so mad at the elites that you wanted to vote for a guy who suspended his campaign to visit his golf course?\r\n\r\n@elisefoley: Regardless of your views on the Brexit, I think we can all agree that \"Brexit\" is a pretty nice little term for it, good job, everyone. \r\n\r\n@aedwardslevy: Bye-Cameronal legislature \r\n\r\nGot something to add?

      "content": "Throughout his career, Gregory Alan Isakov has displayed an ability to reach into musical spaces and create something new. In art, this is the essence of progression: pushing to invent and improve upon what exists. \n\nIsakov's formidable power lies not only in his adept ability to delight with entertaining stories, make the abstract concrete, and provide an insight into the inexorable which life demands of us. His magic is heavily seated in his personal experience, as one who has tried, failed, tried again, and peacefully succeeded. His trajectory is as much a product of his sensitivity of sound as it is the prevailing beauty of serendipity. \n\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-20-1466455397-2420419-isakov2.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-06-20-1466455397-2420419-isakov2.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-20-1466455397-2420419-isakov2-thumb.jpg\" width=\"570\" height=\"380\" /></a>\n\n\"I grew up in South Africa, in the later part of apartheid,\" said Isakov, who lives on a small farm he operates in Boulder, Colorado. \"My dad was brilliant and he started a business in Philadelphia. At first, all I knew about America was the Wizard of Oz and Michael Jackson, and I was scared about tornadoes. \n\n\n\"I had a record player and played 'We Are the World,' and I remember studying the cover.  I think Bob Dylan was the third one to sing (on the USA for Africa charity song in 1985). That was giant for me and also a lot of Paul Simon, and not so much the Simon and Garfunkel stuff, but Simon alone. When I was in Philadelphia, I was in some bands, metal and punk bands, and playing drums and electric guitar. My biggest influence was Tool. I never thought I would do music as a career until I came to Colorado to go to horticultural school. I met Kelly Joe Phelps. I got a rental car and opened for him and I am still doing it - that was 12, 15 years ago.\"\n\n\nThis incredible life animates Isakov constantly; from the first track of his first album (Rust Colored Stones, 2003), he seemed to be writing in the autobiographical mode of someone whose confidence was self-assured. \n\n\n\"I've always looked up to people such as Leonard Cohen and Bruce Springsteen and I've been enamored by their writing styles. I don't think I write anything like that. Take 'The Ghost of Tom Joad' (Springsteen, 1995) and he paints those amazing pictures, it would take a movie two hours long to paint that, and he can do it in one line. The songs and I have this relationship where I've never been able to put my finger on the process. It's a living thing - and I'm reacting to it all of the time. The song, 'Dandelion Wine,' the only thing I had for 8 months was a few lines and then one day it just finished itself, and it's not a long song. It's a relationship that you don't force it.\"\n\n\nPunctured with wit, gloom, hope and spiritually charismatic verse, Isakov's music is an unexpected whim that can change one's whole perspective.\n\n\n\"There are a lot of spins and the whole music thing is a constant parade of delusion,\" said Isakov. \"People see what they want and connect to what they want, connect a story, and that's a beautiful thing. It's like that whole delusion when you see your first grade teacher at the grocery store. I love that sense that we can have this dream about this person or that subject, which is serving us in some way, and you represent something in some way. Music is such a useful thing. I make records and spend time and try to do it as a complete piece of work. And there are a handful of people who appreciate that.\"\n\n\nIt is the nature of music - and a tribute to its power - that a few sounds can so capture the mind and dominate the memory that they form our sense of a time, event, or even era. Isakov's newest album, available June 10, is a highly original and daring collaboration with the Colorado Symphony. The eleven-track record features harmoniously united songs from Isakov's previous albums, 'The Weatherman,' 'This Empty Northern Hemisphere,' and 'That Sea,' 'The Gambler,' well as a new tune called 'Liars.' Songs that resonated strongly before have their core and heart brought to the transcendent constellation. \n\n\nIsakov embarks on an orchestral tour this spring and summer. The event will feature Isakov and his band--Jeb Bows (fiddle), Philip Parker (cello), Steve Varney (electric guitar/banjo), John Grigsby (upright bass), and Max Barcelow (drums)--along with The Ghost Orchestra from Colorado (a symphonic ensemble featuring brass and string players, that includes members of the Colorado Symphony). \n\n\n\"It was a trippy collaboration and I didn't know if I could pull it off,\" said Isakov. \"Having a writing background, I believe in having space and putting space in songs and records to spark a sense of place and space, and I was curious to see how, and, if, it would go with 75 other people playing along. I found a sweet place, darker, bigger, and a little more foreign. I normally make records for one person and a symphony is for a different medium. But playing a show and making a symphony record, I had the best of both worlds, and I was really psyched about it. The orchestra gives the crazy feelings of these well-dressed, well-versed people showing up - and I've gotten to be around some of the best musicians I've ever heard.\n\n\n\"When you see the symphony you hear music in these beautiful rooms meant for music, and it's intentional,\" said Isakov. \"It is miles and miles from any other band venue -playing bars and setting up to head to the next venue. I've been in my share of noisy bars or when you hear the coffee maker happening. But this is a different experience. Music is so sacred and so majestic, and I heard the Colorado Symphony with Brandi Carlile, and I was blown away. It's amazing and hard and it could turn into a train wreck if you are not listening all of the time. Sometimes you don't know where things are going to land. We can really manifest what we want - and because of that weird, universal truth, I ended up working with the Colorado Symphony. Rooms meant for the symphony can get loud without being mic'd. It's like an amphitheatre where every instrument has a speaker in it and there is a kind of power there that's ineffable.\"\n\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-20-1466455446-8491670-isakov.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-06-20-1466455446-8491670-isakov.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-20-1466455446-8491670-isakov-thumb.jpg\" width=\"570\" height=\"380\" /></a>\n\nIsakov lives on a farm in Boulder, Colorado, where the land contains the origins of many of his ideas. Before he made Colorado home, Isakov dropped out of high school and hiked the Appalachian Trail with an 80-pound pack, and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the experience permanently changed his self-view. He fell in love with plants, gardening and the depth of ecosystems, and he didn't question why. He began to self-identify as a part of this big existing organism of life and transposed his newfound fascination with cells and cell structures into a love of gardening.\n\n\nHis farm is self-sustainable and it harvests for a small, local heirloom seed company. In addition to approximately 100 varieties of heirloom seeds, the farm raises sheep and chicken, grows myriad vegetables, as well as cultivates honey and medicinal cannabis.\n\n\n \"Farm work can be the loneliest job, too,\" said Isakov. \"I enjoy gardening full time and I miss it. I've spent time alone planting fruit trees, running a side cutter - giant machines that cut right beneath the grass and where it comes out it in rolls - and then bringing in the compost, and starting again. Long hours in my own garden where every pine needle needs to be taken out of the bed. But music has never had a sense of desperation to me, which I find in the business a lot. If it doesn't work out it would be okay, because I love so many things. I do feel crazy blessed to do my art now. Yes, I know the struggle and the empty rooms and the thinking that, 'hey, maybe tomorrow night will be better.' Those feelings that it is clearly not working. When you have to do something, you figure out a way to do it. It's not about re-shaping the world, just a feeling of innateness, and that I need to do this, and need to figure out a way.\"\n\nIsakov said that, despite whatever persona he has enacted in his public life, he clutches to shy, introverted tendencies.\n\n\n\"I don't think I've ever mastered it or have been able to get over that part of it,\" said Isakov. \"I do have that feeling of pacing around like a mad scientist or an old person in a robe with cigarette burns, and I feel like that person. Once I start playing - then it's fine. It's not about me. It's about the songs. I focus on that and that's what really brings me a big blanket of peace around it. It's interesting because it can be extremely lonely, even in big rooms and a lot of people. You are far away from them and you meet them in a circus way, a picture or sign this, or you are wrapping cables into the night and no one is around. That's a trippy juxtaposition of what that room was like 20 minutes earlier. I am used to gardening alone all the time. One thing is that I travel and play with friends and it's a consciously group experience.\" \n\n\nWhere farm life allows him to focus productively on the goals of the earth, it doesn't take all that much for the singer-songwriter element in Isakov to begin thinking more seriously, more analytically.\n\n\n\"I could be walking downtown and see the headline of a newspaper,\" said Isakov. \"It's the constant sense of noticing in the world and that's really part of being alive, and there is a lot happening. I went to a Buddhist college in Boulder and I've tried to notice when I am thinking too much and not be attached to the thought. You breathe and stare at the ground.\"\n\n\nBoth music and farming are Isakov's need to reach a higher state of consciousness - to tell a story by digging into his guitar or feel connected by digging into the dirt. When the artisan within discovers new terrain such as a partnership with a symphony orchestra, he feels it is his responsibility to cultivate it. \n\n\"I find emotion everywhere and I see the whole world as this fucked up, sad, happy, beautiful song. You can grab what you can from it or just let it be there.\"\n\n<em>Brian D'Ambrosio is the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Life-Trenches-Brian-DAmbrosio-ebook/dp/B00MYHM74Y\" target=\"_hplink\">\"Life in the Trenches,\"</a> a collection of profiles of entertainment wrestlers, boxers, 1980s-era actors and contemporary musicians, including James McMurtry, Earl Campbell, Earnie Shavers, George \"The Animal\" Steele and \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper.</em> ",

      "plain_text": "Throughout his career, Gregory Alan Isakov has displayed an ability to reach into musical spaces and create something new. In art, this is the essence of progression: pushing to invent and improve upon what exists. \n\nIsakov's formidable power lies not only in his adept ability to delight with entertaining stories, make the abstract concrete, and provide an insight into the inexorable which life demands of us. His magic is heavily seated in his personal experience, as one who has tried, failed, tried again, and peacefully succeeded. His trajectory is as much a product of his sensitivity of sound as it is the prevailing beauty of serendipity. \n\n\n\n\"I grew up in South Africa, in the later part of apartheid,\" said Isakov, who lives on a small farm he operates in Boulder, Colorado. \"My dad was brilliant and he started a business in Philadelphia. At first, all I knew about America was the Wizard of Oz and Michael Jackson, and I was scared about tornadoes. \n\n\n\"I had a record player and played 'We Are the World,' and I remember studying the cover.  I think Bob Dylan was the third one to sing (on the USA for Africa charity song in 1985). That was giant for me and also a lot of Paul Simon, and not so much the Simon and Garfunkel stuff, but Simon alone. When I was in Philadelphia, I was in some bands, metal and punk bands, and playing drums and electric guitar. My biggest influence was Tool. I never thought I would do music as a career until I came to Colorado to go to horticultural school. I met Kelly Joe Phelps. I got a rental car and opened for him and I am still doing it - that was 12, 15 years ago.\"\n\n\nThis incredible life animates Isakov constantly; from the first track of his first album (Rust Colored Stones, 2003), he seemed to be writing in the autobiographical mode of someone whose confidence was self-assured. \n\n\n\"I've always looked up to people such as Leonard Cohen and Bruce Springsteen and I've been enamored by their writing styles. I don't think I write anything like that. Take 'The Ghost of Tom Joad' (Springsteen, 1995) and he paints those amazing pictures, it would take a movie two hours long to paint that, and he can do it in one line. The songs and I have this relationship where I've never been able to put my finger on the process. It's a living thing - and I'm reacting to it all of the time. The song, 'Dandelion Wine,' the only thing I had for 8 months was a few lines and then one day it just finished itself, and it's not a long song. It's a relationship that you don't force it.\"\n\n\nPunctured with wit, gloom, hope and spiritually charismatic verse, Isakov's music is an unexpected whim that can change one's whole perspective.\n\n\n\"There are a lot of spins and the whole music thing is a constant parade of delusion,\" said Isakov. \"People see what they want and connect to what they want, connect a story, and that's a beautiful thing. It's like that whole delusion when you see your first grade teacher at the grocery store. I love that sense that we can have this dream about this person or that subject, which is serving us in some way, and you represent something in some way. Music is such a useful thing. I make records and spend time and try to do it as a complete piece of work. And there are a handful of people who appreciate that.\"\n\n\nIt is the nature of music - and a tribute to its power - that a few sounds can so capture the mind and dominate the memory that they form our sense of a time, event, or even era. Isakov's newest album, available June 10, is a highly original and daring collaboration with the Colorado Symphony. The eleven-track record features harmoniously united songs from Isakov's previous albums, 'The Weatherman,' 'This Empty Northern Hemisphere,' and 'That Sea,' 'The Gambler,' well as a new tune called 'Liars.' Songs that resonated strongly before have their core and heart brought to the transcendent constellation. \n\n\nIsakov embarks on an orchestral tour this spring and summer. The event will feature Isakov and his band--Jeb Bows (fiddle), Philip Parker (cello), Steve Varney (electric guitar/banjo), John Grigsby (upright bass), and Max Barcelow (drums)--along with The Ghost Orchestra from Colorado (a symphonic ensemble featuring brass and string players, that includes members of the Colorado Symphony). \n\n\n\"It was a trippy collaboration and I didn't know if I could pull it off,\" said Isakov. \"Having a writing background, I believe in having space and putting space in songs and records to spark a sense of place and space, and I was curious to see how, and, if, it would go with 75 other people playing along. I found a sweet place, darker, bigger, and a little more foreign. I normally make records for one person and a symphony is for a different medium. But playing a show and making a symphony record, I had the best of both worlds, and I was really psyched about it. The orchestra gives the crazy feelings of these well-dressed, well-versed people showing up - and I've gotten to be around some of the best musicians I've ever heard.\n\n\n\"When you see the symphony you hear music in these beautiful rooms meant for music, and it's intentional,\" said Isakov. \"It is miles and miles from any other band venue -playing bars and setting up to head to the next venue. I've been in my share of noisy bars or when you hear the coffee maker happening. But this is a different experience. Music is so sacred and so majestic, and I heard the Colorado Symphony with Brandi Carlile, and I was blown away. It's amazing and hard and it could turn into a train wreck if you are not listening all of the time. Sometimes you don't know where things are going to land. We can really manifest what we want - and because of that weird, universal truth, I ended up working with the Colorado Symphony. Rooms meant for the symphony can get loud without being mic'd. It's like an amphitheatre where every instrument has a speaker in it and there is a kind of power there that's ineffable.\"\n\n\n\nIsakov lives on a farm in Boulder, Colorado, where the land contains the origins of many of his ideas. Before he made Colorado home, Isakov dropped out of high school and hiked the Appalachian Trail with an 80-pound pack, and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the experience permanently changed his self-view. He fell in love with plants, gardening and the depth of ecosystems, and he didn't question why. He began to self-identify as a part of this big existing organism of life and transposed his newfound fascination with cells and cell structures into a love of gardening.\n\n\nHis farm is self-sustainable and it harvests for a small, local heirloom seed company. In addition to approximately 100 varieties of heirloom seeds, the farm raises sheep and chicken, grows myriad vegetables, as well as cultivates honey and medicinal cannabis.\n\n\n \"Farm work can be the loneliest job, too,\" said Isakov. \"I enjoy gardening full time and I miss it. I've spent time alone planting fruit trees, running a side cutter - giant machines that cut right beneath the grass and where it comes out it in rolls - and then bringing in the compost, and starting again. Long hours in my own garden where every pine needle needs to be taken out of the bed. But music has never had a sense of desperation to me, which I find in the business a lot. If it doesn't work out it would be okay, because I love so many things. I do feel crazy blessed to do my art now. Yes, I know the struggle and the empty rooms and the thinking that, 'hey, maybe tomorrow night will be better.' Those feelings that it is clearly not working. When you have to do something, you figure out a way to do it. It's not about re-shaping the world, just a feeling of innateness, and that I need to do this, and need to figure out a way.\"\n\nIsakov said that, despite whatever persona he has enacted in his public life, he clutches to shy, introverted tendencies.\n\n\n\"I don't think I've ever mastered it or have been able to get over that part of it,\" said Isakov. \"I do have that feeling of pacing around like a mad scientist or an old person in a robe with cigarette burns, and I feel like that person. Once I start playing - then it's fine. It's not about me. It's about the songs. I focus on that and that's what really brings me a big blanket of peace around it. It's interesting because it can be extremely lonely, even in big rooms and a lot of people. You are far away from them and you meet them in a circus way, a picture or sign this, or you are wrapping cables into the night and no one is around. That's a trippy juxtaposition of what that room was like 20 minutes earlier. I am used to gardening alone all the time. One thing is that I travel and play with friends and it's a consciously group experience.\" \n\n\nWhere farm life allows him to focus productively on the goals of the earth, it doesn't take all that much for the singer-songwriter element in Isakov to begin thinking more seriously, more analytically.\n\n\n\"I could be walking downtown and see the headline of a newspaper,\" said Isakov. \"It's the constant sense of noticing in the world and that's really part of being alive, and there is a lot happening. I went to a Buddhist college in Boulder and I've tried to notice when I am thinking too much and not be attached to the thought. You breathe and stare at the ground.\"\n\n\nBoth music and farming are Isakov's need to reach a higher state of consciousness - to tell a story by digging into his guitar or feel connected by digging into the dirt. When the artisan within discovers new terrain such as a partnership with a symphony orchestra, he feels it is his responsibility to cultivate it. \n\n\"I find emotion everywhere and I see the whole world as this fucked up, sad, happy, beautiful song. You can grab what you can from it or just let it be there.\"\n\nBrian D'Ambrosio is the author of \"Life in the Trenches,\" a collection of profiles of entertainment wrestlers, boxers, 1980s-era actors and contemporary musicians, including James McMurtry, Earl Campbell, Earnie Shavers, George \"The Animal\" Steele and \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper.",

      "content": "Debt can be crippling, and finding a way to erase it is the key to good financial health. An often-overlooked tool to accomplish this is by transferring the balance you owe on a high-interest card to one with little or no interest (at least for a while). \n\nBalance transfers are a known debt repayment hack, and credit card issuers know\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-23-1464036873-6479740-debtreliefbluesky2016300x186v3.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-05-23-1464036873-6479740-debtreliefbluesky2016300x186v3.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-23-1464036873-6479740-debtreliefbluesky2016300x186v3-thumb.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"186\"  style=\"float: right; margin:10px\" /></a> this. Which is why there are now several balance transfer credit cards on the market.\n\nBut of course, <strong><a href=\"http://www.cardratings.com/balance-transfer-credit-cards?src=608074\" target=\"_hplink\">balance transfer credit card offers</a></strong> are not all created equal. In fact, some may have lower fees but a shorter introductory term where you can pay off what you owe while being charged 0 percent interest. By contrast, others may have a longer 0 percent introductory interest rate window but higher fees.\n\nTo take full advantage of a limited duration 0 percent interest rate to pay down debt requires you to be honest about your willingness and ability to make the necessary payments. \"If you miss the deadline to pay off or transfer your debt before the offer expires, it can be very costly,\" says <a href=\"https://www.nav.com/blog/solving-small-business-joined-nav-6722/\" target=\"_hplink\">Gerri Detweiler</a>, Head of Market Education for Nav.com.  \n\nWhether through a balance transfer card or not, the time to pay off your debt is now, while interest rates are still very low. \"Consumers are being given a rare opportunity to make their financial lives easier,\" says <a href=\"http://www.stretcher.com/\" target=\"_hplink\">Gary Foreman</a>, founder of The Dollar Stretcher website. \"The Federal Reserve has been talking about raising interest rates for quite some time. Normally, we don't get this type of warning. Anyone who is paying attention wants to lock in low rates on the money they owe.\" Higher rates mean debts will be even more costly to pay off, says Foreman.\n\nBalance transfer credit cards with long and generous introductory interest rate offers are a tool to eliminate your debt. We've rounded up a list of the best long-term balance transfer credit cards with introductory offers that range between 15 and 24 months.\n\n<strong><u>IN A CLASS OF ITS OWN</u></strong>\n\n<strong>Chase Slate<sup>®</sup>*</strong>\n\nThis card is in a class of its own among long-term balance transfer credit cards. It's not because its introductory offer is 15 months at 0 percent APR. It's because that initial <a href=\"http://www.bestprepaiddebitcards.com/chase-slate-card-review-h-blbtc-2016-2\" target=\"_hplink\"> <strong>0% APR for 15 months has no fee</strong></a>, which is a rarity in today's market (click for detailed card review and application info).\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-23-1464037522-8923541-earthviewspaceatnightclassbyitself300x300.fw.png\"><img alt=\"2016-05-23-1464037522-8923541-earthviewspaceatnightclassbyitself300x300.fw.png\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-23-1464037522-8923541-earthviewspaceatnightclassbyitself300x300.fw-thumb.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"294\" style=\"float: right; margin:10px\"  /></a>\n\nRemember, several of these cards offer terms as long as 21 to 24 months. Depending on how big your balance is, you could still really get slammed with those 3 percent balance transfer fees.\n\nAs long as you know you can pay off your debt in 15 months, the <strong>Chase Slate</strong> gives you an opportunity to pay off your balance with absolutely no fees or interest.\n\n<strong><u>TOP LONG-TERM BALANCE TRANSFER CREDIT CARDS</u></strong>\n\n<strong>Citi Simplicity Card<sup>®</sup>*</strong>\n\nThe Citi Simplicity Card made our list for two simple reasons: It has an introductory  <a href=\"http://www.bestprepaiddebitcards.com/citi-simplicity-card-review-h-blbtc-2016\" target=\"_hplink\"><strong>APR of 0 percent and it lasts for 21 months</strong></a>, one of the best offers on the market (click for detailed card review and application info). Second, its \"No Late Fees Ever\" promise is truly unique. \n\nThere is a 3 percent balance transfer fee, but that lack of late fees and penalties makes it worthwhile. Remember: Even though this card doesn't charge late fees, not paying your bill on time will still result in a lower credit score and could raise your rate to the penalty rate.\n\n<strong>Santander Sphere<sup>®</sup> Signature Card</strong>\n\nThe Santander Sphere Signature card offers a <u>24-month 0 percent APR</u> introductory rate when you complete a balance transfer within the first 90 days of opening an account. At 4 percent, the balance transfer fee is a little higher than competing cards. But this can be outweighed by the additional three months of 0 percent APR when compared to the Citi Simplicity. After all, you can pay off a lot of debt with an extra three months.\n\nRare for a balance transfer card, the Santander Sphere Signature card has a rewards program. You receive one point for every dollar you spend, which can then be used to redeem rewards, such as gift cards, travel perks or cash back.  You will want to note that it is not 0 percent on purchases, only balance transfers, so it would be unwise to use the card for purchases during the transfer period.  \n\n<strong>Discover it<sup>®</sup> Card*</strong>\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.bestprepaiddebitcards.com/discover-it-card-review-h-blbtc-2016\" target=\"_hplink\"><strong>Discover it</strong></a> card gives you 0 percent APR on balance transfers for 18 months. The balance transfer has a 3 percent fee. Discover sweetens the deal by offering 0 percent APR on purchases made within the first 6 months after opening an account.\n\nIn other words, this is a great card for doing double duty. Not only can you get 0 percent APR on a balance transfer of existing debt, you can also use the card if you need to make a large purchase. But remember: Adding more debt through a purchase will make it harder to pay off your balance within 18 months. \n\n<strong>NASA Federal Credit Union Card </strong> \n\nThe NASA Federal Credit Union card offers a 7.9 percent balance transfer for life. In other words, there is no limit to the incredibly low APR. There's also no balance transfer fee.\n\nThis could be a great card for individuals who know they will take longer than 18, 21 or 24 months to pay off their debt. When the introductory APRs on the other cards expire, the rate is usually double what's being offered by this card.\n\n<strong>BankAmericard Credit Card*</strong>\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.bestprepaiddebitcards.com/bank-americard-18-mo-card-review-h-blbtc-2016\" target=\"_hplink\">BankAmericard</a> credit card offers 0 percent APR on balance transfers for the first 18 months and has a 3 percent transfer fee. After the initial 18 months, the BankAmericard offers one of the lowest ongoing APR of any of the BankAmericard products. The ongoing APR is between 11.24 and 21.24 percent, depending on your creditworthiness.<iframe width=\"580\" height=305\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wgOuTJs2F34\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThis card also offers credit education resources, making it a good card for individuals who are looking for a long-term balance transfer card in an effort to pay off their debt and improve their credit.\n\n<strong>Barclay Bank NFL Extra Points Card*</strong>\n\nAlthough U.K. based Barclay Bank has been offering credit cards in the U.S. for several years, the bank still is far from a household name here and is a bit of a best kept secret. The balance transfer offer of the <a href=\"http://www.bestprepaiddebitcards.com/barclaycard-nfl-extra-points-card-review-h-blbtc-2016\" target=\"_hplink\">NFL Extra Points card</a> is impressive, though not quite a touchdown. It offers 15 months on transfers made within the first 45 days and comes with the industry standard 3% fee. After that, a variable purchase APR applies, currently 15.24%-25.24%, based on your creditworthiness. \n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-23-1464037376-7018669-payoffcreditcardscalendar2016300254v3.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-05-23-1464037376-7018669-payoffcreditcardscalendar2016300254v3.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-23-1464037376-7018669-payoffcreditcardscalendar2016300254v3-thumb.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"254\"  style=\"float: right; margin:10px\" /></a>\n\nWhile not the best transfer offer on the market, the card also offers a unique 0% promotional APR for 6 months on NFL ticket purchases from any participating NFL team ticket office. Another nice perk is complimentary online FICO credit score access.\n\n<strong>Simmons Bank Visa<sup>®</sup> Platinum*</strong>\n\nIf you're looking for a long-term balance transfer credit card that doesn't have a balance transfer fee, look no further than the <a href=\"http://www.bestprepaiddebitcards.com/simmons-bank-card-review-h-blbtc-2016\" target=\"_hplink\">Simmons Bank Visa Platinum card</a>. Though the card charges no balance transfer fee, it does levy a variable 7.5 percent APR on balance transfers made within the first 90 days of opening the account. This is comparable to the NASA card, although at a lower rate.\n\nA unique feature of the card: Unlike many other cards on this list, the APR following the introductory rate does not vary depending on your credit worthiness. With the Simmons card, it's simply a flat 7.5 percent, if you get approved. \n\n\n\n\n<strong><u>BEST LOCAL AND REGIONAL LONG-TERM BALANCE TRANSFER CARDS</u></strong>\n\nSometimes the best long-term balance transfer credit cards don't come from large national chains and credit unions. Instead, you can find some gems right where you live. Here is a sampling of some of the most attractive offers, but be sure to consult with locally owned and operated banks and credit unions in your area.\n\n<strong>First National Bank of Omaha Platinum Edition<sup>®</sup> Visa<sup>®</sup> Card</strong>\n\nThis is a good regional card worth considering.  First National Bank of Omaha <a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-24-1464131177-4158959-localregional3D300x300.jpg\"><img alt=\"2016-05-24-1464131177-4158959-localregional3D300x300.jpg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-24-1464131177-4158959-localregional3D300x300-thumb.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" style=\"float: right; margin:10px\" /></a>\ncurrently offers the Platinum Edition Visa Card with a long-term balance transfer period  available to people who reside in Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota or Texas.  These cards offer a 0 percent APR on balance transfers for 15 months along with a 3 percent balance transfer fee. After the introductory period, the bank offers APRs as low as 10.24% up to 18.24%. \n\n<em>Note</em>:  This is an interesting side note for those applying for a transfer offer with another issuer.  Although not a balance transfer card, we did not want to neglect to mention another card worth considering from FNBO:  the Complete Rewards Visa Card.  This card offers a 15 month<strong> 0% APR on purchases</strong>, not balance transfers.  This could be a nice complementary card to use while paying down your transferred balance if you expect to be making some purchases along the way.\n\n<strong>TruWest Credit Union Visa<sup>®</sup> Platinum Card</strong>\n\nThe TruWest Credit Union Visa Platinum credit card is a long-term balance transfer card available to people who reside in parts of Arizona and Texas. The card offers a 0 percent APR on balance transfers for 18 months, though there is a 3 percent fee. After the introductory period, the credit union offers APRs as low as a very rare rate of 6.5 percent, a real bargain. \n\n<strong>TruService Community Federal Credit Union Visa<sup>®</sup> Platinum Card</strong>\n\nArkansans looking for a long-term balance transfer credit card won't find a better deal than what's offered by the TruService Community Federal Credit Union.\n\nTruService lives up to its name with a ridiculous ongoing APR as low as 5.5 percent. This is the <u>lowest ongoing rate in the nation</u> (that we are currently aware of). There's also no balance transfer fee within the first 60 days. After that, it's only $25 per card.\n\n<strong>Logix Platinum Rewards MasterCard<sup>®</sup></strong>\n\nThe Logix Platinum Rewards MasterCard offers a very unique variable long-term balance transfer deal of 4.99 percent to 9.99 percent APR for 24 months with no balance transfer fee.  It also has no foreign transaction fees, a plus for travelers.  The transfer rate is based on your creditworthiness, so if you can get the lower rate, this is a good offer, but if you get the higher rate, it's not that great.  For those qualifying for the lower rates, this can be a great option for individuals in Southern California who need to find a way to pay off high-interest debt.\n\n\n<strong><u>WHAT TO LOOK FOR</u></strong>  \n\nLong-term balance transfer credit cards are a great solution for individuals who are looking to pay down their high-interest debts once and for all. In a nutshell, here's what makes a card worth looking at: It must have a long introductory period 0 percent APR, decent fees and low ongoing APRs. All of the cards above fit the bill and can help you improve your financial situation.\n\n<strong>CHECKLIST BEFORE YOU TRANSFER</strong>\n\n<strong>-\tIdentify which balance(s) and which card(s) you want to transfer.</strong>\nThis can be as simple or complicated as you choose to make it depending on your goals and how many cards and balances you are looking to transfer.  For many people, they may be simply transferring debt from one card to another.  Others may want to consolidate debt from multiple cards, especially if they can move all balances to one card at 0%.  It is good to know in advance what balance(s) you want to transfer.  If you have some cards that you do not have a balance on, you can contact those issuers to see what kind of balance transfer deal they may be able to offer to win your business.\n\n<strong>-\tIdentify how much you plan on paying per month and how fast you can pay it off.  </strong>\nThis can impact which card you choose.  If you determine that you can pay off your current debt within twelve months, you open the range of cards to select from.  If you figure out that 15-18 or 24 months is a more realistic assessment of how fast you could pay the transferred balance off, you may want to strongly consider one of the cards with longer intro rates or plan for transferring to another card with a balance transfer offer when that intro offer expires.  \n\n<strong>-\tCheck your credit score.</strong>  \nKnowing your credit score is handy to helping know what card or cards you can be approved for.  The higher your score, the more options you will have in applying for a great balance transfer card.  If your FICO credit score is 720-750 or higher, you should have no problem qualifying for most cards that state that \"Excellent credit is required.\"  <a href=\"http://www.wisepiggy.com\" target=\"_hplink\">Click here</a> to check your credit score.  \n\nConsider the impact of transferring a balance on your credit score, but maintain your focus on the goal.  Although it could negatively impact your credit score, especially in the short term, you should be more concerned with taking advantage of the offers that allow you to pay off your debt the fastest and at the lowest rate possible.  In the long run, that will be the best toward eliminating debt and improving your credit score.\n\n<strong>-\tGet an idea on how much you can be approved for on the new card.</strong> \nIf you have not applied for a card in a while, you may be flying blind on this one.  A number of factors influence how much credit you will be awarded including your current debt load, credit score and other items.  If you apply online, you should know fairly soon if you are approved and how much credit you qualify for.  If the amount is not enough to cover the balance you wish to transfer, contact the card issuer and see if they can do anything to extend that to help accommodate the balance(s) you are wanting to transfer.  Worst case, you can apply for multiple cards (from different issuers) to accommodate the total balance and identify which amount from which card will go where.  (A word of caution: Each time you apply for a credit card, it can lower your score a little bit on a temporary basis.)\n\n<strong>-\tUse a balance transfer savings calculator to determine which offer is best for your situation. </strong>\nTerms vary on the introductory balance transfer offers.  Most of the 0% offers carry a balance transfer fee typically at 3%, but some are higher.  Other cards offer an intro period without a balance transfer fee.  You can use such <a href=\"https://www.calcxml.com/calculators/balance-transfer\" target=\"_hplink\"><strong>an online calculator</strong></a> to determine how much you will save for each card and see which gives you the biggest bang for your buck over time. \n\n<strong>-\tDecide if you prefer to transfer a balance or get a consolidation loan.</strong>\nIt is true that a balance transfer at 0%  is the absolute lowest rate you can find.  But, crunching the numbers are not 100% of what erasing debt is all about.  Personalities and personal preferences should be considered as well.  Some people are more comfortable with a single fixed monthly payment and a pre-determined final payment date.  In that instance, a loan may be the best route for you.  There are a number of companies offering great rates on personal loans that can be paid off over two to five years on average.  Check out local credit unions first and then local banks to find the best rates and terms.  Also consider online sources such as <a href=\"http://www.payoff.com\" target=\"_hplink\">Payoff.com</a> for debt consolidation loans.  Although not as low as 0%, you may find that you can afford the payment and get a plan that will erase that debt once and for all.  \n\n<strong>-\tDon't try to transfer balances between two cards with the same bank or card issuer. </strong>\nThis may seem like a tip that does not need to be said, but you may have an airline miles card, rewards card or a store card issued by a bank and their logo is not prominent front and center on the card.  Check the issuing bank on the back of the card before applying for that new card.  Banks typically use these balance transfer offers to create new business and are hoping to steal business away from their competitors.  They will not be interested in reducing a rate on a balance they already manage.  Having said all that, many cardholders often have success contacting the existing card issuer and negotiating a lower rate on their current balance.  \n\n<strong>-\tGet the transfer done as soon as possible and know the deadline date.  (Typically, 60 - 90 days.)  </strong>\nMany card issuers have promotional balance transfer offer time periods between 60 to 90 days from the time you open the account.  It is definitely in your best interest to transfer your balance as soon as possible.  The sooner you are paying on a lower interest rate, the better, right?  So, if transferring a balance to help pay it down faster with interest is your goal, don't procrastinate on this.  Get it transferred as soon as possible!\n\n\n<strong>CHECKLIST FOR AFTER THE BALANCE TRANSFER IS DONE</strong>\n\n<strong>-\tPay on your card on time, every month!</strong>\nOk.  So, you know this one.  Late payments can trigger steep late payment fees and can also hurt your credit score.  If you make a late payment, you will most likely lose your low introductory transfer rate and  could get stuck with a high default or penalty rate which can be northwards of around 30%.  In addition, late payments are typically reported to the credit bureau, which could then impact your score.  Automate your payments (at least to the minimum) so you are never late.  You can always go online and make extra payments as well to help pay it down faster.  \n\n<strong>-\tDon't use your new balance transfer credit card if you can help it.</strong>\nAfter you have transferred your balance to the card, you don't want to add more debt.  Unless the card also offers a 0% purchase rate offer for a set time period, any purchase you make on that card will start accruing interest at a higher rate after the grace period.  The goal is to drop the interest for a while so you can pay down the debt.  If you can help it, you don't want to add to it.\n\n<strong>-\tDon't use your card at an ATM or get cash out while shopping. </strong>\nWalking hand-in-hand with the tip to not use your card, we emphatically say to avoid using your card at ATMs or getting cash back at the checkout counter.  These transactions are not your typical \"purchase\" transactions; they are considered cash advances and almost always come with an initial fee, usually around 5% and carry a much higher interest rate.  In addition, there is usually no grace period for cash advances, so interest accrues immediately.  If your shiny new card does offer a 0% purchase rate for a time, these cash advance transactions will not fall under that category.  \n\n<strong>-\tDon't close your old accounts.  </strong>\nAfter you have transferred your balance from one card to another, you may be tempted to close the accounts of those cards that now have a $0 balance.  You do <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> want to do this.  Keeping those accounts open will help you with your credit utilization ratio which is a factor used in determining your overall credit score.  Each card has its own credit utilization ratio, which is the actual debt balance divided by the total credit available.  For factoring your credit score, they also look at the overall credit utilization ratio, which is the total debt balance divided by the total credit available. Your goal is to be below 30%.  As you get new cards and move the balances there, you will have increased your total available credit, which will improve your overall credit utilization ratio.   Also, the age of accounts is also a factor and older accounts can help improve credit scores.  For more information on when to close an account, click here.  The bottom line is: get those cards to a $0 balance as fast as possible, but leave them open to improve your credit score.\n\n<strong>-\tAdd to the payment as you can over time.  </strong>\nWhile experiencing a breather from your earlier interest rate, you may find times when you can pay on the card a little more over time.  Anything you can do to pay off the debt faster is always helpful.  Eventually, the intro rate will end, unless you have locked down with a low ongoing rate. Even paying $10 or $20 extra each month can have a big impact.  Paying extra reduces the balance faster and gives you more of a chance to keep interest charges at bay.\n\n<strong><u>OTHER RESOURCES</u></strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/curtis-arnold/why-even-warren-buffett-s_b_6104756.html?utm_hp_ref=credit-cards\" target=\"_hplink\"><u>Why It's Important to Get Your Credit Score Even If You're Warren Buffett</u></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/aryea-aranoff/fico-the-credit-score-you-need-to-know_b_9098610.html?utm_hp_ref=credit-cards?utm_hp_ref=credit-cards\" target=\"_hplink\"><u>FICO: The Credit Score You Need To Know</u></a>\n \n \n<u>Our Ratings/Disclaimer:</u>\nWhen reviewing these cards, we do our best to put ourselves in your shoes.

      "plain_text": "Debt can be crippling, and finding a way to erase it is the key to good financial health. An often-overlooked tool to accomplish this is by transferring the balance you owe on a high-interest card to one with little or no interest (at least for a while). \n\nBalance transfers are a known debt repayment hack, and credit card issuers know\n this. Which is why there are now several balance transfer credit cards on the market.\n\nBut of course, balance transfer credit card offers are not all created equal. In fact, some may have lower fees but a shorter introductory term where you can pay off what you owe while being charged 0 percent interest. By contrast, others may have a longer 0 percent introductory interest rate window but higher fees.\n\nTo take full advantage of a limited duration 0 percent interest rate to pay down debt requires you to be honest about your willingness and ability to make the necessary payments. \"If you miss the deadline to pay off or transfer your debt before the offer expires, it can be very costly,\" says Gerri Detweiler, Head of Market Education for Nav.com.  \n\nWhether through a balance transfer card or not, the time to pay off your debt is now, while interest rates are still very low. \"Consumers are being given a rare opportunity to make their financial lives easier,\" says Gary Foreman, founder of The Dollar Stretcher website. \"The Federal Reserve has been talking about raising interest rates for quite some time. Normally, we don't get this type of warning. Anyone who is paying attention wants to lock in low rates on the money they owe.\" Higher rates mean debts will be even more costly to pay off, says Foreman.\n\nBalance transfer credit cards with long and generous introductory interest rate offers are a tool to eliminate your debt. We've rounded up a list of the best long-term balance transfer credit cards with introductory offers that range between 15 and 24 months.\n\nIN A CLASS OF ITS OWN\n\nChase Slate®*\n\nThis card is in a class of its own among long-term balance transfer credit cards. It's not because its introductory offer is 15 months at 0 percent APR. It's because that initial  0% APR for 15 months has no fee, which is a rarity in today's market (click for detailed card review and application info).\n\n\nRemember, several of these cards offer terms as long as 21 to 24 months. Depending on how big your balance is, you could still really get slammed with those 3 percent balance transfer fees.\n\nAs long as you know you can pay off your debt in 15 months, the Chase Slate gives you an opportunity to pay off your balance with absolutely no fees or interest.\n\nTOP LONG-TERM BALANCE TRANSFER CREDIT CARDS\n\nCiti Simplicity Card®*\n\nThe Citi Simplicity Card made our list for two simple reasons: It has an introductory  APR of 0 percent and it lasts for 21 months, one of the best offers on the market (click for detailed card review and application info). Second, its \"No Late Fees Ever\" promise is truly unique. \n\nThere is a 3 percent balance transfer fee, but that lack of late fees and penalties makes it worthwhile. Remember: Even though this card doesn't charge late fees, not paying your bill on time will still result in a lower credit score and could raise your rate to the penalty rate.\n\nSantander Sphere® Signature Card\n\nThe Santander Sphere Signature card offers a 24-month 0 percent APR introductory rate when you complete a balance transfer within the first 90 days of opening an account. At 4 percent, the balance transfer fee is a little higher than competing cards. But this can be outweighed by the additional three months of 0 percent APR when compared to the Citi Simplicity. After all, you can pay off a lot of debt with an extra three months.\n\nRare for a balance transfer card, the Santander Sphere Signature card has a rewards program. You receive one point for every dollar you spend, which can then be used to redeem rewards, such as gift cards, travel perks or cash back.  You will want to note that it is not 0 percent on purchases, only balance transfers, so it would be unwise to use the card for purchases during the transfer period.  \n\nDiscover it® Card*\n\nThe Discover it card gives you 0 percent APR on balance transfers for 18 months. The balance transfer has a 3 percent fee. Discover sweetens the deal by offering 0 percent APR on purchases made within the first 6 months after opening an account.\n\nIn other words, this is a great card for doing double duty. Not only can you get 0 percent APR on a balance transfer of existing debt, you can also use the card if you need to make a large purchase. But remember: Adding more debt through a purchase will make it harder to pay off your balance within 18 months. \n\nNASA Federal Credit Union Card  \n\nThe NASA Federal Credit Union card offers a 7.9 percent balance transfer for life. In other words, there is no limit to the incredibly low APR. There's also no balance transfer fee.\n\nThis could be a great card for individuals who know they will take longer than 18, 21 or 24 months to pay off their debt. When the introductory APRs on the other cards expire, the rate is usually double what's being offered by this card.\n\nBankAmericard Credit Card*\n\nThe BankAmericard credit card offers 0 percent APR on balance transfers for the first 18 months and has a 3 percent transfer fee. After the initial 18 months, the BankAmericard offers one of the lowest ongoing APR of any of the BankAmericard products. The ongoing APR is between 11.24 and 21.24 percent, depending on your creditworthiness.\n\nThis card also offers credit education resources, making it a good card for individuals who are looking for a long-term balance transfer card in an effort to pay off their debt and improve their credit.\n\nBarclay Bank NFL Extra Points Card*\n\nAlthough U.K. based Barclay Bank has been offering credit cards in the U.S. for several years, the bank still is far from a household name here and is a bit of a best kept secret. The balance transfer offer of the NFL Extra Points card is impressive, though not quite a touchdown. It offers 15 months on transfers made within the first 45 days and comes with the industry standard 3% fee. After that, a variable purchase APR applies, currently 15.24%-25.24%, based on your creditworthiness. \n\n\nWhile not the best transfer offer on the market, the card also offers a unique 0% promotional APR for 6 months on NFL ticket purchases from any participating NFL team ticket office. Another nice perk is complimentary online FICO credit score access.\n\nSimmons Bank Visa® Platinum*\n\nIf you're looking for a long-term balance transfer credit card that doesn't have a balance transfer fee, look no further than the Simmons Bank Visa Platinum card. Though the card charges no balance transfer fee, it does levy a variable 7.5 percent APR on balance transfers made within the first 90 days of opening the account. This is comparable to the NASA card, although at a lower rate.\n\nA unique feature of the card: Unlike many other cards on this list, the APR following the introductory rate does not vary depending on your credit worthiness. With the Simmons card, it's simply a flat 7.5 percent, if you get approved. \n\n\n\n\nBEST LOCAL AND REGIONAL LONG-TERM BALANCE TRANSFER CARDS\n\nSometimes the best long-term balance transfer credit cards don't come from large national chains and credit unions. Instead, you can find some gems right where you live. Here is a sampling of some of the most attractive offers, but be sure to consult with locally owned and operated banks and credit unions in your area.\n\nFirst National Bank of Omaha Platinum Edition® Visa® Card\n\nThis is a good regional card worth considering.  First National Bank of Omaha \ncurrently offers the Platinum Edition Visa Card with a long-term balance transfer period  available to people who reside in Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota or Texas.  These cards offer a 0 percent APR on balance transfers for 15 months along with a 3 percent balance transfer fee. After the introductory period, the bank offers APRs as low as 10.24% up to 18.24%. \n\nNote:  This is an interesting side note for those applying for a transfer offer with another issuer.  Although not a balance transfer card, we did not want to neglect to mention another card worth considering from FNBO:  the Complete Rewards Visa Card.  This card offers a 15 month 0% APR on purchases, not balance transfers.  This could be a nice complementary card to use while paying down your transferred balance if you expect to be making some purchases along the way.\n\nTruWest Credit Union Visa® Platinum Card\n\nThe TruWest Credit Union Visa Platinum credit card is a long-term balance transfer card available to people who reside in parts of Arizona and Texas. The card offers a 0 percent APR on balance transfers for 18 months, though there is a 3 percent fee. After the introductory period, the credit union offers APRs as low as a very rare rate of 6.5 percent, a real bargain. \n\nTruService Community Federal Credit Union Visa® Platinum Card\n\nArkansans looking for a long-term balance transfer credit card won't find a better deal than what's offered by the TruService Community Federal Credit Union.\n\nTruService lives up to its name with a ridiculous ongoing APR as low as 5.5 percent. This is the lowest ongoing rate in the nation (that we are currently aware of). There's also no balance transfer fee within the first 60 days. After that, it's only $25 per card.\n\nLogix Platinum Rewards MasterCard®\n\nThe Logix Platinum Rewards MasterCard offers a very unique variable long-term balance transfer deal of 4.99 percent to 9.99 percent APR for 24 months with no balance transfer fee.  It also has no foreign transaction fees, a plus for travelers.  The transfer rate is based on your creditworthiness, so if you can get the lower rate, this is a good offer, but if you get the higher rate, it's not that great.  For those qualifying for the lower rates, this can be a great option for individuals in Southern California who need to find a way to pay off high-interest debt.\n\n\nWHAT TO LOOK FOR  \n\nLong-term balance transfer credit cards are a great solution for individuals who are looking to pay down their high-interest debts once and for all. In a nutshell, here's what makes a card worth looking at: It must have a long introductory period 0 percent APR, decent fees and low ongoing APRs. All of the cards above fit the bill and can help you improve your financial situation.\n\nCHECKLIST BEFORE YOU TRANSFER\n\n-\tIdentify which balance(s) and which card(s) you want to transfer.\nThis can be as simple or complicated as you choose to make it depending on your goals and how many cards and balances you are looking to transfer.  For many people, they may be simply transferring debt from one card to another.  Others may want to consolidate debt from multiple cards, especially if they can move all balances to one card at 0%.  It is good to know in advance what balance(s) you want to transfer.  If you have some cards that you do not have a balance on, you can contact those issuers to see what kind of balance transfer deal they may be able to offer to win your business.\n\n-\tIdentify how much you plan on paying per month and how fast you can pay it off.  \nThis can impact which card you choose.  If you determine that you can pay off your current debt within twelve months, you open the range of cards to select from.  If you figure out that 15-18 or 24 months is a more realistic assessment of how fast you could pay the transferred balance off, you may want to strongly consider one of the cards with longer intro rates or plan for transferring to another card with a balance transfer offer when that intro offer expires.  \n\n-\tCheck your credit score.  \nKnowing your credit score is handy to helping know what card or cards you can be approved for.  The higher your score, the more options you will have in applying for a great balance transfer card.  If your FICO credit score is 720-750 or higher, you should have no problem qualifying for most cards that state that \"Excellent credit is required.\"  Click here to check your credit score.  \n\nConsider the impact of transferring a balance on your credit score, but maintain your focus on the goal.  Although it could negatively impact your credit score, especially in the short term, you should be more concerned with taking advantage of the offers that allow you to pay off your debt the fastest and at the lowest rate possible.  In the long run, that will be the best toward eliminating debt and improving your credit score.\n\n-\tGet an idea on how much you can be approved for on the new card. \nIf you have not applied for a card in a while, you may be flying blind on this one.  A number of factors influence how much credit you will be awarded including your current debt load, credit score and other items.  If you apply online, you should know fairly soon if you are approved and how much credit you qualify for.  If the amount is not enough to cover the balance you wish to transfer, contact the card issuer and see if they can do anything to extend that to help accommodate the balance(s) you are wanting to transfer.  Worst case, you can apply for multiple cards (from different issuers) to accommodate the total balance and identify which amount from which card will go where.  (A word of caution: Each time you apply for a credit card, it can lower your score a little bit on a temporary basis.)\n\n-\tUse a balance transfer savings calculator to determine which offer is best for your situation. \nTerms vary on the introductory balance transfer offers.  Most of the 0% offers carry a balance transfer fee typically at 3%, but some are higher.  Other cards offer an intro period without a balance transfer fee.  You can use such an online calculator to determine how much you will save for each card and see which gives you the biggest bang for your buck over time. \n\n-\tDecide if you prefer to transfer a balance or get a consolidation loan.\nIt is true that a balance transfer at 0%  is the absolute lowest rate you can find.  But, crunching the numbers are not 100% of what erasing debt is all about.  Personalities and personal preferences should be considered as well.  Some people are more comfortable with a single fixed monthly payment and a pre-determined final payment date.  In that instance, a loan may be the best route for you.  There are a number of companies offering great rates on personal loans that can be paid off over two to five years on average.  Check out local credit unions first and then local banks to find the best rates and terms.  Also consider online sources such as Payoff.com for debt consolidation loans.  Although not as low as 0%, you may find that you can afford the payment and get a plan that will erase that debt once and for all.  \n\n-\tDon't try to transfer balances between two cards with the same bank or card issuer. \nThis may seem like a tip that does not need to be said, but you may have an airline miles card, rewards card or a store card issued by a bank and their logo is not prominent front and center on the card.  Check the issuing bank on the back of the card before applying for that new card.  Banks typically use these balance transfer offers to create new business and are hoping to steal business away from their competitors.  They will not be interested in reducing a rate on a balance they already manage.  Having said all that, many cardholders often have success contacting the existing card issuer and negotiating a lower rate on their current balance.  \n\n-\tGet the transfer done as soon as possible and know the deadline date.  (Typically, 60 - 90 days.)  \nMany card issuers have promotional balance transfer offer time periods between 60 to 90 days from the time you open the account.  It is definitely in your best interest to transfer your balance as soon as possible.  The sooner you are paying on a lower interest rate, the better, right?  So, if transferring a balance to help pay it down faster with interest is your goal, don't procrastinate on this.  Get it transferred as soon as possible!\n\n\nCHECKLIST FOR AFTER THE BALANCE TRANSFER IS DONE\n\n-\tPay on your card on time, every month!\nOk.  So, you know this one.  Late payments can trigger steep late payment fees and can also hurt your credit score.  If you make a late payment, you will most likely lose your low introductory transfer rate and  could get stuck with a high default or penalty rate which can be northwards of around 30%.  In addition, late payments are typically reported to the credit bureau, which could then impact your score.  Automate your payments (at least to the minimum) so you are never late.  You can always go online and make extra payments as well to help pay it down faster.  \n\n-\tDon't use your new balance transfer credit card if you can help it.\nAfter you have transferred your balance to the card, you don't want to add more debt.  Unless the card also offers a 0% purchase rate offer for a set time period, any purchase you make on that card will start accruing interest at a higher rate after the grace period.  The goal is to drop the interest for a while so you can pay down the debt.  If you can help it, you don't want to add to it.\n\n-\tDon't use your card at an ATM or get cash out while shopping. \nWalking hand-in-hand with the tip to not use your card, we emphatically say to avoid using your card at ATMs or getting cash back at the checkout counter.  These transactions are not your typical \"purchase\" transactions; they are considered cash advances and almost always come with an initial fee, usually around 5% and carry a much higher interest rate.  In addition, there is usually no grace period for cash advances, so interest accrues immediately.  If your shiny new card does offer a 0% purchase rate for a time, these cash advance transactions will not fall under that category.  \n\n-\tDon't close your old accounts.  \nAfter you have transferred your balance from one card to another, you may be tempted to close the accounts of those cards that now have a $0 balance.  You do NOT want to do this.  Keeping those accounts open will help you with your credit utilization ratio which is a factor used in determining your overall credit score.  Each card has its own credit utilization ratio, which is the actual debt balance divided by the total credit available.  For factoring your credit score, they also look at the overall credit utilization ratio, which is the total debt balance divided by the total credit available. Your goal is to be below 30%.  As you get new cards and move the balances there, you will have increased your total available credit, which will improve your overall credit utilization ratio.   Also, the age of accounts is also a factor and older accounts can help improve credit scores.  For more information on when to close an account, click here.  The bottom line is: get those cards to a $0 balance as fast as possible, but leave them open to improve your credit score.\n\n-\tAdd to the payment as you can over time.  \nWhile experiencing a breather from your earlier interest rate, you may find times when you can pay on the card a little more over time.  Anything you can do to pay off the debt faster is always helpful.  Eventually, the intro rate will end, unless you have locked down with a low ongoing rate. Even paying $10 or $20 extra each month can have a big impact.  Paying extra reduces the balance faster and gives you more of a chance to keep interest charges at bay.\n\nOTHER RESOURCES\n\nWhy It's Important to Get Your Credit Score Even If You're Warren Buffett\n\nFICO: The Credit Score You Need To Know\n \n \nOur Ratings/Disclaimer:\nWhen reviewing these cards, we do our best to put ourselves in your shoes. We choose cards based on such things as (lack of) fees, finance charges and ease of use. In other words, if we wouldn't use these cards ourselves, we wouldn't recommend them!\n\n* NOTE:  About half of the credit card offers that appear in this article are from credit card companies from which we receive financial compensation (these cards are listed as such on our site). They are noted above with an asterisk.  We are proud that we list cards that don't advertise with us--- almost all of our competitors ONLY list cards that advertise with them. The bottom line is that we don't know of another site that prominently lists as many non-advertiser cards.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCo-written by Curtis Arnold, a nationally recognized consumer advocate and founder of CardRatings.com, the pioneering website that started posting the first credit card ratings online around 20 years ago, and Shane Tripcony, personal finance blogger and web marketing consultant.

Yeah, well you might want to add a few of these hotels to that vision. </p>\n\n<p>Lisa Perkovic is <a href=\"http://blog.expedia.com.au/\" target=\"_hplink\">Expedia’s blog editor</a> and is lucky enough to have a long hit list of tried and tested hotels (and an even longer bucket list). So we asked her to help us compile a few of the most luxe accommodation spots from around the globe. Now we just need to buy that lottery ticket. </p>\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.expedia.com.au/Abu-Dhabi-Emirate-Hotels-Emirates-Palace-Abu-Dhabi.h1162753.Hotel-Information\" target=\"_hplink\">Emirates Palace, Abu Dhabi, UAE</a></strong></p>\n<p>Hoteliers in the UAE are no strangers to decadence, though at the Emirates Palace they've taken things to the next level. The whopping 85 hectare resort on the shores of the Persian Gulf had a $2 billion construction price tag, and it’s not hard to see why. Moor your yacht at the hotel’s marina, amble along the cycle trails through manicured grounds, play cricket or football on the full size pitches, pamper yourself inside the the traditional marble Turkish hammam, make a withdrawal at</p>\n<p>the gold ATM or just enjoy your rotating canopy bed. </p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"emirates palace\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4189610/thumbs/o-EMIRATES-PALACE-570.jpg?2\" /></p>\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.expedia.com.au/Vail-Beaver-Creek-Hotels-The-Ritz-Carlton.h883383.Hotel-Information\" target=\"_hplink\">The Ritz Carlton, Bachelor Gulch, Colorado, U.S.A</a></strong></p>\n<p>Aspen is often considered celebrity snow spotting country, but the insider secret is this intimate five star hotel tucked into the bottom of its own ski run. Nearby Beaver Creek is world renowned for five star skiing -- think heated foot paths and escalators to the chair lifts -- but the Ritz Carlton has Bachelor Gulch all to itself. Ski straight from the front door to the chair lift, return to the outdoor fire pit for the giant freshly baked cookie, sup at Spargo (Wolfgang Puck’s award winning restaurant), before sinking into bed with one of those extra special monogrammed pillows.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"the ritz carlton colorado\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4189616/thumbs/o-THE-RITZ-CARLTON-COLORADO-570.jpg?2\" /></p>\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.expedia.com.au/Langkawi-Hotels-The-St-Regis-Langkawi.h13125473.Hotel-Information\" target=\"_hplink\">St Regis Langkawi, Malaysia</a></strong></p>\n<p>Location makes a luxury hotel. In a resort region like Langkawi, staying away from the madding crowd is key. This brand new hotel sits on the edge of a quiet cove, with over-water villas perched at the 100,000 square metre natural lagoon that leads out to the Andaman Sea. Private beach equals paradise in this part of the world. Private cabanas, chic suites and a stunning jungle meets beach design theme take things to the next level.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"st regis langkawi\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4189620/thumbs/o-ST-REGIS-LANGKAWI-570.jpg?1\" /></p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.expedia.com.au/Beijing-Hotels-Aman-At-Summer-Palace-Beijing.h2219817.Hotel-Information\" target=\"_hplink\">Aman at Summer Palace Beijing, China</a></strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes, luxury is about insider access. Ancient Imperial history has captivated the world for centuries, and still draws visitors from all over the world. The Summer Palace is on almost every traveller’s to do list, but forget simply strolling the</p>\n<p>grounds. Instead, get a real sense of place by spending the night at this elegant hotel originally used by guests awaiting an audience with the Empress Dowager Cixi. The pavilions are a pretty jigsaw puzzle of reflection pools and meditation spaces. Expect to see artists offering private calligraphy lessons, with the likes of designer Michael Kors stocking up on souvenirs from the hotel’s collection.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"aman at summer palace\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4189632/thumbs/o-AMAN-AT-SUMMER-PALACE-570.jpg?1\" /></p>\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.expedia.com.au/London-Hotels-Blakes-London.h28508.Hotel-Information\" target=\"_hplink\">Blakes London, England</a></strong></p>\n<p>You don’t have to be a Windsor to live like royalty in London. The Blakes Hotel in South Kensington has plenty of four-poster beds, fine china and general over the top decadence for you to be Lord and Lady during your stay. Rooms are individually decorated to extravagant themes -- there’s the Library Suite for understated luxury, the Venetian Suite if you like four-poster beds encrusted with Murano glass, or maybe you’re more suited to the Cardinal Suite, which has enough red and gold to make you go cross-eyed.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"blakes london\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4189636/thumbs/o-BLAKES-LONDON-570.jpg?2\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.expedia.com.au/Riviera-Maya-Hotels-Rosewood-Mayakoba.h1773497.Hotel-Information\" target=\"_hplink\">Rosewood Mayakoba, Mexico</a></strong></p>\n<p>Minimalism in Mexico? Yes, it does exist! Rosewood properties have a penchant for really nailing luxury. Think a bespoke aesthetic, beautiful locations and very attentive butler service. This intimate resort on the Yucatan Peninsula delivers on all</p>\n<p>accounts, and then some. Known as the luxury hotel of Mexico’s Eastern Coast, it removes all traces of the beach parties and replaces them instead with the peace and quiet of the Riviera Maya’s network of rivers and rainforests and a private</p>\n<p>beach. Deluxe over-water lagoon suites are without question the must-stay here --  their decks “float” out over the lagoon, with steps leading down to the water so your private boat can whisk you around the resort.</p>\n\n<p><br><br></p>\n<p><img alt=\"rosewood mexico\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4189646/thumbs/o-ROSEWOOD-MEXICO-570.jpg?2\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.expedia.com.au/Tetiaroa-Hotels-The-Brando.h9213161.Hotel-Information\" target=\"_hplink\">The Brando, French Polynesia</a></strong></p>\n<p>Celebrities certainly add credibility to a luxury hotel -- they’re drawn like moths to a flame to plunge pools, exclusive restaurants and swanky suites -- but it’s all about Brando at this private island. Marlon Brando discovered Tetiaroa in the sixties while filming 'Mutiny on the Bounty'. It became a secret hideaway out of the spotlight and his family recently realised his lifelong dream to turn the island into a resort. This is no ordinary resort. There are no over-water villas, as Brando didn't want to intrude on nature, so instead villas are tucked into the jungle. This is understated luxury at its best. That’s of course along with a Michelin-starred consultant chef, luxury day spa and world class snorkeling. </p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"the brando\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4189650/thumbs/o-THE-BRANDO-570.jpg?2\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.expedia.co.nz/Kinloch-Hotels-The-Kinloch-Club.h11464398.Hotel-Information\" target=\"_hplink\">The Lodge at Kinloch, Lake Taupo, New Zealand</a></strong></p>\n<p>There’s no denying Kiwis know how to do lodges. This brand new property is an exemplary example of why lodges and luxury go hand in hand. Added to The Kinloch Club, home to New Zealand’s famous Championship golf course, the lodge has been influenced by its namesake Scottish castle -- think cosy chesterfield armchairs, animal skin rugs and roaring fireplaces. All is calm and quiet in rooms that look out over the rolling greens and lake beyond.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"the lodge at kinloch\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4189658/thumbs/o-THE-LODGE-AT-KINLOCH-570.jpg?2\" /></p>\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.expedia.com.au/Cusco-Machu-Picchu-Hotels-Belmond-Hotel-Monasterio.h198415.Hotel-Information\" target=\"_hplink\">Belmond Hotel Monasterio, Cusco, Peru</a></strong></p>\n<p>It may surprise you, but cloisters and cloches seem to go hand in hand. At least they certainly do at this historic hotel. Sitting down to dinner in what was a palace and then a seminary for hundreds of years is definitely a formal affair. Waiters</p>\n<p>synchronise the unveiling of each course from underneath domed silver cloches, making you feel a little like a judge in MasterChef, and very special. There’s plenty of dramatic flourishes at this Cusco hotel, from sacred religious portraits to a plethora of gilded goblets. Book in for a few days of decadence before taking Machu Picchu -- special oxygenated rooms are ideal if you need a little assistance acclimatising.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"belmond hotel monasterio\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4189668/thumbs/o-BELMOND-HOTEL-MONASTERIO-570.jpg?2\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.expedia.com.au/New-York-Hotels-Mandarin-Oriental.h916343.Hotel-Information\" target=\"_hplink\">Mandarin Oriental New York, U.S.A</a></strong></p>\n<p>It’s all about the bathtub at this big player in the Big Apple. Who wants to be down in the hustle and bustle of the concrete jungle when you can look straight down on it all while you soak? The position of your bathroom is one certain way to rate luxury in this city. Looking straight down on Central Park from the very top of the Time Warner Centre at Columbus Circle, the hotel itself is also a great base for exploring the city, if you can tear yourself away from that tub.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"mandarin oriental new york\" src=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/4189674/thumbs/o-MANDARIN-ORIENTAL-NEW-YORK-570.jpg?2\" /></p>\n\n<p><br><br></p>\n<p><center><a data-pin-do=\"embedUser\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/huffpostau/\"data-pin-scale-width=\"80\" data-pin-scale-height=\"200\" data-pin-board-width=\"400\">    Visit HuffPost Australia's profile on Pinterest.</a><!-- Please call pinit.js only once per page --><script type=\"text/javascript\" async src=\"//assets.pinterest.com/js/pinit.js\"></script></center></p>\n\n",

      "plain_text": "\nYou know the daydream where you win a cool 20 mil lotto and then have the joy of diving up a few hundred grand between loved ones before blissfully spending the rest of on yourself? Yeah, well you might want to add a few of these hotels to that vision. \n\n\nLisa Perkovic is Expedia’s blog editor and is lucky enough to have a long hit list of tried and tested hotels (and an even longer bucket list). So we asked her to help us compile a few of the most luxe accommodation spots from around the globe. Now we just need to buy that lottery ticket. \n\n\n\nEmirates Palace, Abu Dhabi, UAE\n\nHoteliers in the UAE are no strangers to decadence, though at the Emirates Palace they've taken things to the next level. The whopping 85 hectare resort on the shores of the Persian Gulf had a $2 billion construction price tag, and it’s not hard to see why. Moor your yacht at the hotel’s marina, amble along the cycle trails through manicured grounds, play cricket or football on the full size pitches, pamper yourself inside the the traditional marble Turkish hammam, make a withdrawal at\n\nthe gold ATM or just enjoy your rotating canopy bed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ritz Carlton, Bachelor Gulch, Colorado, U.S.A\n\nAspen is often considered celebrity snow spotting country, but the insider secret is this intimate five star hotel tucked into the bottom of its own ski run. Nearby Beaver Creek is world renowned for five star skiing -- think heated foot paths and escalators to the chair lifts -- but the Ritz Carlton has Bachelor Gulch all to itself. Ski straight from the front door to the chair lift, return to the outdoor fire pit for the giant freshly baked cookie, sup at Spargo (Wolfgang Puck’s award winning restaurant), before sinking into bed with one of those extra special monogrammed pillows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt Regis Langkawi, Malaysia\n\nLocation makes a luxury hotel. In a resort region like Langkawi, staying away from the madding crowd is key. This brand new hotel sits on the edge of a quiet cove, with over-water villas perched at the 100,000 square metre natural lagoon that leads out to the Andaman Sea. Private beach equals paradise in this part of the world. Private cabanas, chic suites and a stunning jungle meets beach design theme take things to the next level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAman at Summer Palace Beijing, China\n\nSometimes, luxury is about insider access. Ancient Imperial history has captivated the world for centuries, and still draws visitors from all over the world. The Summer Palace is on almost every traveller’s to do list, but forget simply strolling the\n\ngrounds. Instead, get a real sense of place by spending the night at this elegant hotel originally used by guests awaiting an audience with the Empress Dowager Cixi. The pavilions are a pretty jigsaw puzzle of reflection pools and meditation spaces. Expect to see artists offering private calligraphy lessons, with the likes of designer Michael Kors stocking up on souvenirs from the hotel’s collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlakes London, England\n\nYou don’t have to be a Windsor to live like royalty in London. The Blakes Hotel in South Kensington has plenty of four-poster beds, fine china and general over the top decadence for you to be Lord and Lady during your stay. Rooms are individually decorated to extravagant themes -- there’s the Library Suite for understated luxury, the Venetian Suite if you like four-poster beds encrusted with Murano glass, or maybe you’re more suited to the Cardinal Suite, which has enough red and gold to make you go cross-eyed.\n\n\n\n\n\nRosewood Mayakoba, Mexico\n\nMinimalism in Mexico? Yes, it does exist! Rosewood properties have a penchant for really nailing luxury. Think a bespoke aesthetic, beautiful locations and very attentive butler service. This intimate resort on the Yucatan Peninsula delivers on all\n\naccounts, and then some. Known as the luxury hotel of Mexico’s Eastern Coast, it removes all traces of the beach parties and replaces them instead with the peace and quiet of the Riviera Maya’s network of rivers and rainforests and a private\n\nbeach. Deluxe over-water lagoon suites are without question the must-stay here --  their decks “float” out over the lagoon, with steps leading down to the water so your private boat can whisk you around the resort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brando, French Polynesia\n\nCelebrities certainly add credibility to a luxury hotel -- they’re drawn like moths to a flame to plunge pools, exclusive restaurants and swanky suites -- but it’s all about Brando at this private island. Marlon Brando discovered Tetiaroa in the sixties while filming 'Mutiny on the Bounty'. It became a secret hideaway out of the spotlight and his family recently realised his lifelong dream to turn the island into a resort. This is no ordinary resort. There are no over-water villas, as Brando didn't want to intrude on nature, so instead villas are tucked into the jungle. This is understated luxury at its best. That’s of course along with a Michelin-starred consultant chef, luxury day spa and world class snorkeling. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lodge at Kinloch, Lake Taupo, New Zealand\n\nThere’s no denying Kiwis know how to do lodges. This brand new property is an exemplary example of why lodges and luxury go hand in hand. Added to The Kinloch Club, home to New Zealand’s famous Championship golf course, the lodge has been influenced by its namesake Scottish castle -- think cosy chesterfield armchairs, animal skin rugs and roaring fireplaces. All is calm and quiet in rooms that look out over the rolling greens and lake beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelmond Hotel Monasterio, Cusco, Peru\n\nIt may surprise you, but cloisters and cloches seem to go hand in hand. At least they certainly do at this historic hotel. Sitting down to dinner in what was a palace and then a seminary for hundreds of years is definitely a formal affair. Waiters\n\nsynchronise the unveiling of each course from underneath domed silver cloches, making you feel a little like a judge in MasterChef, and very special. There’s plenty of dramatic flourishes at this Cusco hotel, from sacred religious portraits to a plethora of gilded goblets. Book in for a few days of decadence before taking Machu Picchu -- special oxygenated rooms are ideal if you need a little assistance acclimatising.\n\n\n\n\n\nMandarin Oriental New York, U.S.A\n\nIt’s all about the bathtub at this big player in the Big Apple. Who wants to be down in the hustle and bustle of the concrete jungle when you can look straight down on it all while you soak? The position of your bathroom is one certain way to rate luxury in this city. Looking straight down on Central Park from the very top of the Time Warner Centre at Columbus Circle, the hotel itself is also a great base for exploring the city, if you can tear yourself away from that tub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Visit HuffPost Australia's profile on Pinterest.\n\n",

The four-motor EV will be driven in the Electric Modified Class by Tetsuya Yamano, who has been testing the car at the Hill Climb for the past few weeks. Acura is also running <a href=\"http://www.autoblog.com/2016/06/09/2017-acura-nsx-ev-pikes-peak-official/\">two NSX hybrids</a> up the hill in the challenge next weekend.<br />\n<br />\nSo, what's different inside this NSX-like EV? Like the <a href=\"http://www.autoblog.com/2015/06/23/2015-pikes-peak-hill-climb-practice-day-1-photos/\">all-electric Honda CR-Z</a> that Yamano drove up Pikes Peak last year &ndash; winning the Challenge Exhibition class with a time of 10:23.829 &ndash; the NSX-inspired EV uses two Twin Motor Units (TMU) from the company's Sport Hybrid SH-AWD powertrain. Each axle has a TMU and that means that the car, \"has achieved independent torque distribution to all four corners &ndash; true four-wheel torque vectoring,\" according to Acura. That sounds nice, but the real test will be out in Colorado in just a few days.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Related Video</strong>:<br />\n<br />\n<!-- TAG START { player: \"Autoblog\", owner: \"Autoblog\", for: \"Autoblog\" } --><img alt=\"All-Electirc NSX To Tackle Pikes Peak | Autoblog Minute\" id=\"aol-cms-player-1\" src=\"//cdn.vidible.tv/prod/2016-06/17/5761c702e4b07a81b8653880_853x480_U_v2.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 360px;\" />\n<div class=\"vdb_player vdb_56faaf3de4b0bae7652233c45640b67abbe5bf46d4cabf1e\" vdb_params=\"m.vls.rays=ghfe\"><script src=\"//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=56faaf3de4b0bae7652233c4/vid=5761c702e4b07a81b8653880/5640b67abbe5bf46d4cabf1e.js?m.vls.rays=ghfe\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">try{document.getElementById(\"aol-cms-player-1\").style.display=\"none\";}catch(e){}</script>\n\n<div id=\"pr_box\">\n<div id=\"pr_box_button\">Show full PR text</div>\n\n<div id=\"pr_text\"><strong>Acura NSX-Inspired EV Concept Ready to 'Charge Up' Pikes Peak Vehicle Features World's First All-Electric, 4-Motor SH-AWD&reg; Powertrain</strong><br />\n<br />\nJun 20, 2016<br />\n<br />\nTORRANCE, Calif. &ndash; Acura will campaign an all-electric, NSX-inspired EV Concept in the Electric Modified Class at the 2016 Broadmoor Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. The Acura EV Concept features a further evolution of the experimental, all-electric, 4-motor Super Handling All-Wheel Drive&trade; (SH-AWD&reg;) powertrain that won last year's Pikes Peak Challenge Exhibition class.<br />\n<br />\nThe supercar-inspired Acura EV Concept will be driven by Tetsuya Yamano, who campaigned last year's CR-Z-based electric prototype. The Acura EV Concept is the ultimate embodiment of the all-wheel-drive Electric SH-AWD powertrain featuring a world's first technology that enables four-wheel independent torque allocation. The Acura EV Concept's Electric SH-AWD powertrain produces three times the total system output of last year's electric prototype and is mated to the NSX body.<br />\n<br />\n\"We've been tuning the car for several weeks at Pikes and have advanced its performance significantly,\" said Tetsuya Yamano. \"We're honored to be running at Pikes in this historical, anniversary year &ndash; an event respected by racing fans all over the world.\"<br />\n<br />\n4-Motor Development<br />\nHonda R&amp;D has been developing \"super handling\" technology for more than 20 years in the pursuit of ideal vehicle handling. By applying separate Twin Motor Units (TMUs), the brains of Sport Hybrid SH-AWD, on each axle, Acura has achieved independent torque distribution to all four corners &ndash; true four-wheel torque vectoring. Based upon the learnings from last year's race, the team updated the system management of the powertrain for more precise thrust at each wheel.<br />\n<br />\nAcura's unique Sport Hybrid SH-AWD technology utilizes the highly responsive acceleration characteristics and regeneration capability of electric motors to further advance the torque vectoring systems currently applied to NSX, and available on RLX and the upcoming 2017 MDX. The system enables ideal handling characteristics in various driving situations by coordinating and managing all dynamic systems, including Electronic Power Steering (EPS), Vehicle Stability Assist&trade; (VSA&reg;) and Sport Hybrid SH-AWD.<br />\n<br />\nWith its high-output electric motors and 4-motor torque vectoring, the Concept is well suited to the demands of the 156 complex corners the driver will encounter on the drive up Pikes Peak.<br />\n<br />\nFor More Information<br />\nConsumer information is available at www.acura.com.

      "plain_text": "With Pikes Peak right around the corner, Acura is showing off more details about its NSX-inspired all-electric racer. The four-motor EV will be driven in the Electric Modified Class by Tetsuya Yamano, who has been testing the car at the Hill Climb for the past few weeks. Acura is also running two NSX hybrids up the hill in the challenge next weekend.\n\n\n\nSo, what's different inside this NSX-like EV? Like the all-electric Honda CR-Z that Yamano drove up Pikes Peak last year – winning the Challenge Exhibition class with a time of 10:23.829 – the NSX-inspired EV uses two Twin Motor Units (TMU) from the company's Sport Hybrid SH-AWD powertrain. Each axle has a TMU and that means that the car, \"has achieved independent torque distribution to all four corners – true four-wheel torque vectoring,\" according to Acura. That sounds nice, but the real test will be out in Colorado in just a few days.\n\n\n\nRelated Video:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow full PR text\n\nAcura NSX-Inspired EV Concept Ready to 'Charge Up' Pikes Peak Vehicle Features World's First All-Electric, 4-Motor SH-AWD® Powertrain\n\n\n\nJun 20, 2016\n\n\n\nTORRANCE, Calif. – Acura will campaign an all-electric, NSX-inspired EV Concept in the Electric Modified Class at the 2016 Broadmoor Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. The Acura EV Concept features a further evolution of the experimental, all-electric, 4-motor Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD®) powertrain that won last year's Pikes Peak Challenge Exhibition class.\n\n\n\nThe supercar-inspired Acura EV Concept will be driven by Tetsuya Yamano, who campaigned last year's CR-Z-based electric prototype. The Acura EV Concept is the ultimate embodiment of the all-wheel-drive Electric SH-AWD powertrain featuring a world's first technology that enables four-wheel independent torque allocation. The Acura EV Concept's Electric SH-AWD powertrain produces three times the total system output of last year's electric prototype and is mated to the NSX body.\n\n\n\n\"We've been tuning the car for several weeks at Pikes and have advanced its performance significantly,\" said Tetsuya Yamano. \"We're honored to be running at Pikes in this historical, anniversary year – an event respected by racing fans all over the world.\"\n\n\n\n4-Motor Development\n\nHonda R&D has been developing \"super handling\" technology for more than 20 years in the pursuit of ideal vehicle handling. By applying separate Twin Motor Units (TMUs), the brains of Sport Hybrid SH-AWD, on each axle, Acura has achieved independent torque distribution to all four corners – true four-wheel torque vectoring. Based upon the learnings from last year's race, the team updated the system management of the powertrain for more precise thrust at each wheel.\n\n\n\nAcura's unique Sport Hybrid SH-AWD technology utilizes the highly responsive acceleration characteristics and regeneration capability of electric motors to further advance the torque vectoring systems currently applied to NSX, and available on RLX and the upcoming 2017 MDX. The system enables ideal handling characteristics in various driving situations by coordinating and managing all dynamic systems, including Electronic Power Steering (EPS), Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®) and Sport Hybrid SH-AWD.\n\n\n\nWith its high-output electric motors and 4-motor torque vectoring, the Concept is well suited to the demands of the 156 complex corners the driver will encounter on the drive up Pikes Peak.\n\n\n\nFor More Information\n\nConsumer information is available at www.acura.com.

Additional media information including pricing, features and high-resolution photography is available at acuranews.com/channels/acura-automobiles.\n\n\n\nAbout Acura\n\nAcura is a leading automotive luxury nameplate that delivers Precision Crafted Performance, an original approach to technology and design that creates a new driving experience. On March 27, 2016, Acura celebrated the 30th anniversary of its launch as the first luxury nameplate from a Japanese automaker.\n\n\n\nThe Acura lineup features five distinctive models – the RLX luxury flagship sedan, the TLX performance luxury sedan, the ILX sport sedan, the 5-passenger RDX luxury crossover SUV, and the seven-passenger Acura MDX, America's all-time best-selling three-row luxury SUV.

We are thrilled to have Gary's support to help further our fight against today's growing epidemic:\n\nFebruary of 2015 was the last time I saw my son. I visited him at his rehab facility in Carbondale, Colorado. We skied Snowmass on the last day I was there. We had a nice dinner with one of his friends who was also in recovery. I felt hopeful. We discussed what he would do after rehab. We made plans for his stepsister to come live with him in the summer. I recognized the Garrett that I had once known - quick-witted, wicked smart, loving, full of life.   \n\nBut on April 22, 2015, my wife answered a late evening knock on the door only to see two police officers. I was on a business trip in New York City, and horrifically she had to deliver the life-shattering news confirming my worst nightmare. My oldest son, Garrett, had died from an accidental overdose of a lethal combination of sedatives and opioids - just one week after leaving rehab.\n\nI agonized over whether I should fly to the rehab facility in Colorado or to my home in Kansas City. Finally, I chose Kansas City as I needed to tell my parents face-to-face. By the time I arrived, word of Garrett's death was already surfacing on social media. Panicked my parents might see the posts on Facebook, I raced to their house to break the painful news. \n\nWhen my parents asked what I planned to tell people about my son's death, I chose the truth. I wasn't ashamed and I didn't care if people judged me. \n\nIn the Midwest, we tend to avoid uncomfortable conversations. We sweep things under the rug to protect ourselves and our loved ones from the shame and judgment of others, but in reality we only perpetuate the issue. Addiction is a chronic brain disease, yet society scorns addicts as if it is a moral failure. Individuals who suffer from this disease, and their families, are isolated by this judgment and shame - even long after recovery.    \n\nAnd make no mistake - addiction can touch any family. In 2016, addiction to prescription drugs, illicit drugs, and alcohol will take the life of approximately 135,000 Americans annually, regardless of race, creed, religion, wealth or status. <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6450a3.htm\" target=\"_hplink\">Drug-related overdoses has quadrupled in the past 15 years</a>, and is now the leading cause of accidental death in the U.S. - exceeding gun violence and car crashes. Despite startling statistics and troubling trends, I discovered a major philanthropic gap related to addiction, specifically opioid abuse. \n\nAfter Garrett's death, I took a leave of absence from my job as president and CIO of Mariner Holdings, a national financial services company, to start a non-profit dedicated to four pillars: advocacy, stigma reduction, prevention and scientific research. I wanted to take my experience as a business executive and apply it to this epidemic. In my ongoing research I learned about Shatterproof, a national non-profit devoted to the same four pillars. Shatterproof, founded by Gary Mendell, former CEO of HEI Hotels and Resorts and president of Starwood Lodging Trust, was several years ahead of me, funded and scalable. \n\nI met with Gary and decided to leverage my efforts and fold my foundation into Shatterproof. I was thrilled to be appointed to Shatterproof's board of directors last month and we have been working closely ever since.\n\nAs businessmen, Gary and I share the understanding that in order to make change, we need a clear plan and sufficient resources. There is no easy fix, but there are clear, evidenced-based steps we all can take to help dramatically slow this preventable disease. \n\nI've heard too many parents say, \"not my child\" or \"not in my town\" - and too many principals say \"not in my school.\" Kansas City is no exception. Just recently I met with Garrett's friends. In the short span since I last spoke with them, two more kids have overdosed in our metro region.\n\nTo reduce the devastation caused by addiction, we need to get to our kids before they are addicted. There has been momentum building, but more is needed to create meaningful change. <a href=\"http://www.shatterproof.org/pages/take-action\" target=\"_hplink\">Please join me in supporting Shatterproof.</a>\n\nGary Henson is president and chief investment officer of Mariner Holdings, a national financial services company with two main subsidiaries and $35 billion in assets under management. Mr. Henson serves on the Board of Shatterproof, a national non-profit dedicated to reducing the devastation that addiction to prescription drugs, illicit drugs, and alcohol causes to families. ",

I was thrilled to be appointed to Shatterproof's board of directors last month and we have been working closely ever since.\n\nAs businessmen, Gary and I share the understanding that in order to make change, we need a clear plan and sufficient resources. There is no easy fix, but there are clear, evidenced-based steps we all can take to help dramatically slow this preventable disease. \n\nI've heard too many parents say, \"not my child\" or \"not in my town\" - and too many principals say \"not in my school.\" Kansas City is no exception. Just recently I met with Garrett's friends. In the short span since I last spoke with them, two more kids have overdosed in our metro region.\n\nTo reduce the devastation caused by addiction, we need to get to our kids before they are addicted. There has been momentum building, but more is needed to create meaningful change. Please join me in supporting Shatterproof.\n\nGary Henson is president and chief investment officer of Mariner Holdings, a national financial services company with two main subsidiaries and $35 billion in assets under management. Mr. Henson serves on the Board of Shatterproof, a national non-profit dedicated to reducing the devastation that addiction to prescription drugs, illicit drugs, and alcohol causes to families. ",

She said that he beat her over things like <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/ex-wife-of-suspected-orlando-shooter-he-beat-me/2016/06/12/8a1963b4-30b8-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">unfinished laundry</a>, confiscated her paychecks and banned her from speaking to her family -- acts that left her feeling isolated, vulnerable and afraid. </p>\n<p>\"He would often get into fights and arguments with his parents but because I was the only one in his life <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/13/orlando-massacre-omar-mateens-ex-wife-says-he-beat-her-and-held-her-hostage\" target=\"_blank\">most of the violence was towards me</a> at that time,\" she told reporters from her home in Colorado, where she eventually moved after divorcing Mateen in 2009. </p>\n<p>\"My family literally rescued me,\" she said. \"They had to pull me out of his arms and buy an emergency flight. I left all my belongings.\"</p>\n<p>Seven years later, Mateen's violence would be directed outward, toward Orlando's vibrant gay community. On early Sunday morning, he stormed the nightclub Pulse, slaughtering 49 people and injuring another 53 before police killed him after an hourslong standoff. </p>\n<div class=\"embed-asset embed\" data-type=\"embed-asset\" data-provider=\"Embed\" data-title=\"\">\n<div class=\"embed-code\"><div id=\"vidible_14664408481\" class=\"vdb_player vdb_5668ae6ee4b0b5e26955d6a656000e19e4b0e4e194b84b31\" vdb_params=\"m.fwkeyvalues=sponsorship%3DSPONSORSHIP_NAME&m.fwsitesection=composer\"><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=5668ae6ee4b0b5e26955d6a6/vid=575e105ce4b0ba9572570882/56000e19e4b0e4e194b84b31.js\"></script></div></div><script type='text/javascript'>function onPlayerReadyVidible(e){'undefined'!=typeof HPTrack&&HPTrack.Vid.Vidible_track(e)}!function(e,i){if(e.vdb_Player){if('object'==typeof commercial_video){var a='',o='m.fwsitesection='+commercial_video.site_and_category;if(a+=o,commercial_video['package']){var c='&m.fwkeyvalues=sponsorship%3D'+commercial_video['package'];a+=c}e.setAttribute('vdb_params',a)}i(e.vdb_Player)}else{var t=arguments.callee;setTimeout(function(){t(e,i)},0)}}(document.getElementById('vidible_1'),onPlayerReadyVidible);</script></div>\n     \n<p>While Yusifiy says she never saw Mateen support terrorism, public discussion has focused on his potential terrorist connections after reports that he called 911 and pledged allegiance to the so-called Islamic State. Did he actually have <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/13/us/orlando-omar-mateen-isis.html\" target=\"_blank\">ties to ISIS</a>? Did he harbor anti-American sentiments? Did he in fact cheer when he heard about the Sept. 11 attacks? We don't know all the answers yet, but by singlehandedly focusing on this line of questioning, we risk overlooking more critical indicators. </p>\n<p>To understand if authorities missed clues that Mateen was capable of carrying out a massacre, we must look to his history of domestic violence -- and that of so many before him who have committed mass killings.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Time after time, men (and yes, it is mostly men) who commit horrific acts of violence against the public have a history of domestic violence against the women closest to them. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Before Robert Dear shot to death three strangers in a <a href=\"http://new.www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/planned-parenthood-shooter-robert-dear-targeted-women-closer-to-home_us_565f1e71e4b079b2818cc03c\">Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs</a> last fall, he allegedly beat his wives, targeted other women he came into contact with, was charged with rape and arrested under a \"Peeping Tom\" law.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Before Tamerlan Tsarnaev planted bombs at the Boston Marathon with his brother in 2013, killing three people and injuring more than 260 others, he was arrested for <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/boston-bomber-abused-speaks-article-1.1330014\" target=\"_blank\">beating his girlfriend</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In February, Cedric Ford stormed through multiple Kansas townships with an <a href=\"http://new.www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kansas-shooting-dead_us_56cf9cb8e4b0871f60eadc59\">assault rifle and a pistol</a>, killing three and injuring 14. Ninety minutes earlier, he'd been served him with <a href=\"http://new.www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kansas-shooting-ex-girlfriend-protective-order_us_56d097bde4b0bf0dab31f2e6\">a restraining order</a> stemming from a domestic violence complaint filed by his ex-girlfriend.  </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In 2014, when gunman <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/15/man-haron-monis-syria-hos_n_6326736.html\">Man Haron Monis</a> seized hostages in a cafe in Sydney, Australia, he was out on bail after being charged as an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And so on. The examples are too numerous to list. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As Shannon Frattaroli, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/6/14/11922576/orlando-shooting-omar-mateen-gun-domestic-violence\" target=\"_blank\">told Vox</a>, \"We know that violence is the best predictor of future violence.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In fact, according to one analysis of criminal offenders in Washington State, a felony domestic violence conviction may actually be the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/03/opinion/to-stop-violence-start-at-home.html\" target=\"_blank\">single greatest predictor</a> of future violent crime among men. </p>\n<p>\"Men who commit violence rehearse and perfect it against their families first,\" wrote <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/03/opinion/to-stop-violence-start-at-home.html\" target=\"_blank\">activists Pamela Shifman and Salamishah Tillet</a> in a New York Times op-ed last year. \"Women and children are target practice, and the home is the training ground for these men’s later actions.\"</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://new.www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mass-shootings-domestic-violence-women_us_55d3806ce4b07addcb44542a\">Huffington Post analyzed</a> five years of data on mass shootings (commonly defined one in which at least four people are killed) compiled by the gun violence prevention organization <a href=\"http://everytownresearch.org/?source=prno_HuffPoMassShootings&utm_source=pr_n_&utm_medium=_o&utm_campaign=HuffPoMassShootings\" target=\"_blank\" data-beacon=\"{\"p\":{\"mnid\":\"entry_text\",\"lnid\":\"citation\",\"mpid\":5}}\">Everytown For Gun Safety</a>. We found that in 57 percent of mass shootings, the shooter targeted either a family member or an intimate partner.</p>\n<p>It's unclear if police were ever notified of Mateen's alleged violence against his ex-wife, and he does not appear to have any convictions for domestic violence, which would have <a href=\"http://new.www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gun-control-connecticut_us_5734ca9ee4b08f96c1827a64\">prohibited him from owning guns under federal law</a>.</p>\n<p>But even if Yusifiy did not report his abuse to authorities, as many domestic violence victims do not, she was not the only person who bore witness to his misogynistic tendencies and erratic behavior. </p>\n<p>One of Mateen's co-workers, Daniel Gilroy, told The Los Angeles Times that he \"<a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-orlando-nightclub-shooting-live-former-coworker-i-complained-multiple-1465777922-htmlstory.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-beacon=\"{\"p\":{\"mnid\":\"entry_text\",\"lnid\":\"citation\",\"mpid\":5}}\">complained multiple times that [Mateen] was dangerous</a>\" and that he <a href=\"http://new.www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/omar-mateen-identified-orlando-club-shooter_us_575d6f19e4b0ced23ca84a64\">showed anger</a> toward black people, gay people, Jewish people and women.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"He did not like black people at all. That was mentioned once or twice, but more so was women,\" Gilroy<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/orlando-nightclub-massacre/terror-hate-what-motivated-orlando-nightclub-shooter-n590496\" target=\"_blank\"> told NBC News</a>. \"He did not like women at all. He did like women in a sexual way, but he did not respect them.\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Of course, not all domestic abusers will commit horrific acts of violence against the public. But when men abuse their partners, they are broadcasting that they are violent, dangerous and potentially able to turn that violence against others. It's a warning sign that should be taken seriously. </p>\n<p>We know that domestic violence is quite common in the U.S., where it affects 1 in 4 women and every single day <a href=\"http://testkitchen.huffingtonpost.com/this-is-not-a-love-story/\">claims three women's lives</a>. Now, it's critical that we begin to recognize it as a key warning sign of a person's potential to commit violence against others. It is a serious issue worth tackling as a public health epidemic -- not just something private that occurs behind closed doors.</p>\n<p>\"Possible ties to terrorist groups seem to be more interesting and frightening to the public than a history of domestic violence, which sadly has become part of the everyday fabric of our society,\" said Kim Gandy, president of the National Network To End Domestic Violence.</p>\n<p>\"Yet by overlooking the fact that many domestic violence perpetrators kill multiple victims – including but not limited to mass shootings – we are missing an opportunity to prevent some of this deadly violence, through better enforcement of laws prohibiting domestic abusers’ access to firearms, and by holding abusers accountable for their behavior when it is initially identified.\"</p>\n<p><em>Need help?

      "plain_text": "\n\nLong before 29-year-old Omar Mateen opened fire in a popular gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, and committed the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, he perpetrated a different type of terror -- one he kept hidden inside the home.\n\nHe beat his wife. \n\nSitora Yusifiy, who was married to Mateen for four months, has described him as a cruel and physically violent man. She said that he beat her over things like unfinished laundry, confiscated her paychecks and banned her from speaking to her family -- acts that left her feeling isolated, vulnerable and afraid. \n\n\"He would often get into fights and arguments with his parents but because I was the only one in his life most of the violence was towards me at that time,\" she told reporters from her home in Colorado, where she eventually moved after divorcing Mateen in 2009. \n\n\"My family literally rescued me,\" she said. \"They had to pull me out of his arms and buy an emergency flight. I left all my belongings.\"\n\nSeven years later, Mateen's violence would be directed outward, toward Orlando's vibrant gay community. On early Sunday morning, he stormed the nightclub Pulse, slaughtering 49 people and injuring another 53 before police killed him after an hourslong standoff. \n\n\n     \n\nWhile Yusifiy says she never saw Mateen support terrorism, public discussion has focused on his potential terrorist connections after reports that he called 911 and pledged allegiance to the so-called Islamic State. Did he actually have ties to ISIS? Did he harbor anti-American sentiments? Did he in fact cheer when he heard about the Sept. 11 attacks? We don't know all the answers yet, but by singlehandedly focusing on this line of questioning, we risk overlooking more critical indicators. \n\nTo understand if authorities missed clues that Mateen was capable of carrying out a massacre, we must look to his history of domestic violence -- and that of so many before him who have committed mass killings.\n\nTime after time, men (and yes, it is mostly men) who commit horrific acts of violence against the public have a history of domestic violence against the women closest to them. \n\nBefore Robert Dear shot to death three strangers in a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs last fall, he allegedly beat his wives, targeted other women he came into contact with, was charged with rape and arrested under a \"Peeping Tom\" law.\n\nBefore Tamerlan Tsarnaev planted bombs at the Boston Marathon with his brother in 2013, killing three people and injuring more than 260 others, he was arrested for beating his girlfriend.\n\nIn February, Cedric Ford stormed through multiple Kansas townships with an assault rifle and a pistol, killing three and injuring 14. Ninety minutes earlier, he'd been served him with a restraining order stemming from a domestic violence complaint filed by his ex-girlfriend.  \n\nIn 2014, when gunman Man Haron Monis seized hostages in a cafe in Sydney, Australia, he was out on bail after being charged as an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. \n\nAnd so on. The examples are too numerous to list. \n\nAs Shannon Frattaroli, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Vox, \"We know that violence is the best predictor of future violence.\"\n\nIn fact, according to one analysis of criminal offenders in Washington State, a felony domestic violence conviction may actually be the single greatest predictor of future violent crime among men. \n\n\"Men who commit violence rehearse and perfect it against their families first,\" wrote activists Pamela Shifman and Salamishah Tillet in a New York Times op-ed last year. \"Women and children are target practice, and the home is the training ground for these men’s later actions.\"\n\nThe Huffington Post analyzed five years of data on mass shootings (commonly defined one in which at least four people are killed) compiled by the gun violence prevention organization Everytown For Gun Safety. We found that in 57 percent of mass shootings, the shooter targeted either a family member or an intimate partner.\n\nIt's unclear if police were ever notified of Mateen's alleged violence against his ex-wife, and he does not appear to have any convictions for domestic violence, which would have prohibited him from owning guns under federal law.\n\nBut even if Yusifiy did not report his abuse to authorities, as many domestic violence victims do not, she was not the only person who bore witness to his misogynistic tendencies and erratic behavior. \n\nOne of Mateen's co-workers, Daniel Gilroy, told The Los Angeles Times that he \"complained multiple times that [Mateen] was dangerous\" and that he showed anger toward black people, gay people, Jewish people and women.\n\n\"He did not like black people at all. That was mentioned once or twice, but more so was women,\" Gilroy told NBC News. \"He did not like women at all. He did like women in a sexual way, but he did not respect them.\"\n\nOf course, not all domestic abusers will commit horrific acts of violence against the public. But when men abuse their partners, they are broadcasting that they are violent, dangerous and potentially able to turn that violence against others. It's a warning sign that should be taken seriously. \n\nWe know that domestic violence is quite common in the U.S., where it affects 1 in 4 women and every single day claims three women's lives. Now, it's critical that we begin to recognize it as a key warning sign of a person's potential to commit violence against others. It is a serious issue worth tackling as a public health epidemic -- not just something private that occurs behind closed doors.\n\n\"Possible ties to terrorist groups seem to be more interesting and frightening to the public than a history of domestic violence, which sadly has become part of the everyday fabric of our society,\" said Kim Gandy, president of the National Network To End Domestic Violence.\n\n\"Yet by overlooking the fact that many domestic violence perpetrators kill multiple victims – including but not limited to mass shootings – we are missing an opportunity to prevent some of this deadly violence, through better enforcement of laws prohibiting domestic abusers’ access to firearms, and by holding abusers accountable for their behavior when it is initially identified.\"\n\nNeed help? In the U.S., call 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) for the National Domestic Violence Hotline.\n\n_____\n\nRelated stories: \n\nThis Is Not A Love Story: Examining A Month Of Deadly Domestic Violence In America\nWhy Didn’t You Just Leave?

      "content": "Twiddle is a band that has been on my radar for years. I live in their home state of Vermont and they are the talk of the town. Many of my friends identify themselves as Twiddleheads and I didn't get it until I saw them do their thing live. It has been really interesting to watch them move up in the scene and to witness their growth and expansion as artists. It seems to me that all their hard work is finally paying off and people are starting to take notice. From sold out shows all over the country at famous venues like the Capitol Theater to playing Red Rocks in Colorado twice to having amazing artists like Matisyahu and Nahko Bear collaborating with them, there is no denying that Twiddle has arrived. \n\nMihali Savoulidis is Twiddle's extremely talented lead singer and guitarist. When presented with the opportunity to get to pick his brain a little bit about all the new and exciting stuff that has been happening to Twiddle, I jumped at the chance. \n\n<strong>Taraleigh: You just announced the line-up for your <a href=\"http://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1090741?utm_medium=bks\" target=\"_hplink\">Tumble Down Festival</a> that's happening July 29-30 at the beautiful Burlington Waterfront Park. How did you choose the bands? </strong>\n\n<center><a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-09-1465488847-4915270-a.jpeg\"><img alt=\"2016-06-09-1465488847-4915270-a.jpeg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-09-1465488847-4915270-a-thumb.jpeg\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" /></a>\nPhoto Credit Zach Stone Photography</center>\n\n<strong>Mihali:</strong> When we were choosing the bands for the Tumble Down lineup we wanted to give our fans and people attending the event some variety in genre and style as well as killer performances. We know all these bands personally and have been playing with them for years now. I'm really happy they were all able to do it.\n<strong>\nTaraleigh: The lineup is stacked with so many of my favorite bands. I'm looking forward to shaking my sweet ass all weekend long at one of the most beautiful venues in the world. I'm obviously excited that you chose Burlington, VT because there is nothing better than being able to ride your bike to a show, but why did you decide to do it there? </strong>\n\n<strong>Mihali: </strong>Burlington is a very special place for our band. It's the home base for the Vermont music scene and a place that has helped us grow and become the band we are today. It's a magical city and the waterfront is one of the best and most beautiful places to see a concert hands down. \n\n<strong>Taraleigh: One of my favorite things about Burlington Waterfront Park is that the band gets to face the lake and take in the magic when the sun is setting over the Adirondack Mountains. I have seen it totally change the direction of a show. Besides getting to play to an epic sunset, what are you most excited about for Tumble Down?</strong>\n\n<strong>Mihali:</strong> The thing I'm most excited about for Tumble Down is definitely going to be the collaboration aspect of the whole event. We as a band love to play with as many people as possible. The bands we have chosen also have a passion for collaboration. With all the after parties we have scheduled, Burlington is going to be flooded with killer music and good people all weekend long.\n\n<center> <a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-09-1465492824-2461154-aaa.jpeg\"><img alt=\"2016-06-09-1465492824-2461154-aaa.jpeg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-09-1465492824-2461154-aaa-thumb.jpeg\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" /></a> Photo Credit Greg Horowitz Photography</center>\n\n<strong>Taraleigh: I love to watch musicians who don't normally play together all of a sudden get to that place where their music becomes one. You recently got to sit in with Matisyahu and Nahko and the Medicine for the People at Higher Ground Ballroom in Burlington. How did that come about?</strong>\n\n<strong>Mihali:</strong> I've been a huge fan of Matisyahu for years now and it was an honor to have him come play with us at The Capital Theatre and then I got to play with his band at Higher Ground. We met through a mutual friend Pete Spadero who is one of our lighting designers. Matisyahu is such an amazing guy and I'm very happy to say that we are working on a new project together called MihaliMatis. We will be releasing the first single this summer and I'm really excited about it. I also had the chance to play with Nahko and Medicine for the People as well. I have known those guys for awhile and have always wanted to sit in with them. It was very cool when they asked me to play both nights with them at Higher Ground. They are the nicest guys and amazing musicians. I am happy to call them my brothers. \n\n<center><a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-09-1465491730-9905984-aaaa.jpeg\"><img alt=\"2016-06-09-1465491730-9905984-aaaa.jpeg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-09-1465491730-9905984-aaaa-thumb.jpeg\" width=\"500\" height=\"374\" /></a></center>\n<center>Photo Credit Greg Horowitz Photography</center>\n\n<strong>Taraleigh: Matisyahu and Nahko and Medicine for the People are some of the best in the business. It seems like you are all getting so much out of your relationship together. Lately everyone has been talking about Twiddle and how they are the next big band to come out of Vermont. What are your feelings about that? </strong>\n\n<strong>Mihali</strong>: We love Vermont! We have a ton of pride and love for our state so we just hope to represent it as best we can in the music scene. We owe all of our success to our fans. They have taken us out of the bars and into clubs and then out of the clubs and into theaters. They really are the best.\n<strong>\nTaraleigh: I'm looking forward to seeing where the fans take you next. From my perception, Twiddle is a band that goes above and beyond for their fans. Why do you take the time from an already busy schedule to do special things for them?</strong>\n\n<strong>Mihali: </strong>The fans come first. Like I was saying before, our fans are everything to us and they are the reason for our success. They always have our backs. We are constantly trying to figure out new cool things we can do for them. My manager Kevin Rondeau really prides himself and the band on our customer service. We want our fans to be happy because they have made our dreams come true time and time again.\n\n<strong>Taraleigh: They made them come true by selling out The Capitol Theatre recently. What were your first thoughts when you found out that the shows had sold out?</strong>\n\n<center><a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-09-1465493106-6323909-aa.jpeg\"><img alt=\"2016-06-09-1465493106-6323909-aa.jpeg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-09-1465493106-6323909-aa-thumb.jpeg\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" /></a> Photo Credit Greg Horowitz Photography</center>\n<strong>\nMihali: </strong>When we first heard that The Cap had sold out, we were all together pre-show in the green room rehearsing our song King Without a Crown. We all stopped. With huge smiles on our faces we gave each other some hugs and high fives and then realized it was game time and got right back down to rehearsing. There was a nervous excited energy buzzing around that green room from that moment on for sure.\n<strong>\nTaraleigh: I can only imagine what that was like for you guys. Can you describe how it felt after playing your first note to that sold out crowd? </strong>\n\n<strong>Mihali: </strong>We opened the night with a new song Blunderbuss off of Plump Chapter Two. It felt so good to play in that room and even better to be playing a new song we all love. \n\n<strong>Taraleigh: If your music was an Muppet, which Muppet would it be and why?</strong>\n\n<strong>Mihali: </strong>Haha! I think it would be many different ones because we have many different styles and influences that go into our music.  A little Kermit. Some Fozzy. Definitely Gonzo. Even Miss Piggy. They all have a place in our tunes.\n\n<strong>Taraleigh: How would your grandma describe Twiddle? </strong>\n\n<strong>Mihali:. </strong>My grandma (Grandma Fox RIP) would probably say something like \"They are very talented, but it's a bit loud for my taste.\" (Said with a very proper British accent) I think my grandpa (Grandpa Fox RIP) would have really liked Twiddle. He had an amazing collection of music and also played mandolin and banjo. I have a very distinct memory of him listening to String Cheese Incident's version of Take Five. My brother Yianni and I had played for him and he loved it.\n<strong>\nTaraleigh: What are you most excited about right now? </strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-09-1465491619-4505930-aaaaa.jpeg\"><img alt=\"2016-06-09-1465491619-4505930-aaaaa.jpeg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-09-1465491619-4505930-aaaaa-thumb.jpeg\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" /></a><a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-09-1465491662-7934835-aaaaaa.jpeg\"><img alt=\"2016-06-09-1465491662-7934835-aaaaaa.jpeg\" src=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-06-09-1465491662-7934835-aaaaaa-thumb.jpeg\" width=\"169\" height=\"250\" /></a>\n\n\n<strong>Mihali:</strong>  Right now I am just excited about life in general. The music has been great and the band has been playing really well. We've been getting some amazing opportunities lately and the future is looking very bright. More than anything I am loving being a father. My daughter is the sweetest little girl ever and my wife is the strongest, greatest mother. They are everything to me and fill me with love and inspiration every single day. That's all I need to keep the creative juices flowing into the music. Life is really good right now and I've never been happier.\n<strong>\nTaraleigh: It's all happening. Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to share a little bit about yourself with me. See you at the Tumble Down if not sooner.</strong>\n<center>\nThe awesome in me sees and bows to the awesome in you,\n\nTaraleigh</center>\n\nMusic legend Oteil Burbridge and Taraleigh are hosting a retreat this fall that you can participate in from your own home.

      "plain_text": "Twiddle is a band that has been on my radar for years. I live in their home state of Vermont and they are the talk of the town. Many of my friends identify themselves as Twiddleheads and I didn't get it until I saw them do their thing live. It has been really interesting to watch them move up in the scene and to witness their growth and expansion as artists. It seems to me that all their hard work is finally paying off and people are starting to take notice. From sold out shows all over the country at famous venues like the Capitol Theater to playing Red Rocks in Colorado twice to having amazing artists like Matisyahu and Nahko Bear collaborating with them, there is no denying that Twiddle has arrived. \n\nMihali Savoulidis is Twiddle's extremely talented lead singer and guitarist. When presented with the opportunity to get to pick his brain a little bit about all the new and exciting stuff that has been happening to Twiddle, I jumped at the chance. \n\nTaraleigh: You just announced the line-up for your Tumble Down Festival that's happening July 29-30 at the beautiful Burlington Waterfront Park. How did you choose the bands? \n\n\nPhoto Credit Zach Stone Photography\n\nMihali: When we were choosing the bands for the Tumble Down lineup we wanted to give our fans and people attending the event some variety in genre and style as well as killer performances. We know all these bands personally and have been playing with them for years now. I'm really happy they were all able to do it.\n\nTaraleigh: The lineup is stacked with so many of my favorite bands. I'm looking forward to shaking my sweet ass all weekend long at one of the most beautiful venues in the world. I'm obviously excited that you chose Burlington, VT because there is nothing better than being able to ride your bike to a show, but why did you decide to do it there? \n\nMihali: Burlington is a very special place for our band. It's the home base for the Vermont music scene and a place that has helped us grow and become the band we are today. It's a magical city and the waterfront is one of the best and most beautiful places to see a concert hands down. \n\nTaraleigh: One of my favorite things about Burlington Waterfront Park is that the band gets to face the lake and take in the magic when the sun is setting over the Adirondack Mountains. I have seen it totally change the direction of a show. Besides getting to play to an epic sunset, what are you most excited about for Tumble Down?\n\nMihali: The thing I'm most excited about for Tumble Down is definitely going to be the collaboration aspect of the whole event. We as a band love to play with as many people as possible. The bands we have chosen also have a passion for collaboration. With all the after parties we have scheduled, Burlington is going to be flooded with killer music and good people all weekend long.\n\n  Photo Credit Greg Horowitz Photography\n\nTaraleigh: I love to watch musicians who don't normally play together all of a sudden get to that place where their music becomes one. You recently got to sit in with Matisyahu and Nahko and the Medicine for the People at Higher Ground Ballroom in Burlington. How did that come about?\n\nMihali: I've been a huge fan of Matisyahu for years now and it was an honor to have him come play with us at The Capital Theatre and then I got to play with his band at Higher Ground. We met through a mutual friend Pete Spadero who is one of our lighting designers. Matisyahu is such an amazing guy and I'm very happy to say that we are working on a new project together called MihaliMatis. We will be releasing the first single this summer and I'm really excited about it. I also had the chance to play with Nahko and Medicine for the People as well. I have known those guys for awhile and have always wanted to sit in with them. It was very cool when they asked me to play both nights with them at Higher Ground. They are the nicest guys and amazing musicians. I am happy to call them my brothers. \n\n\nPhoto Credit Greg Horowitz Photography\n\nTaraleigh: Matisyahu and Nahko and Medicine for the People are some of the best in the business. It seems like you are all getting so much out of your relationship together. Lately everyone has been talking about Twiddle and how they are the next big band to come out of Vermont. What are your feelings about that? \n\nMihali: We love Vermont! We have a ton of pride and love for our state so we just hope to represent it as best we can in the music scene. We owe all of our success to our fans. They have taken us out of the bars and into clubs and then out of the clubs and into theaters. They really are the best.\n\nTaraleigh: I'm looking forward to seeing where the fans take you next. From my perception, Twiddle is a band that goes above and beyond for their fans. Why do you take the time from an already busy schedule to do special things for them?\n\nMihali: The fans come first. Like I was saying before, our fans are everything to us and they are the reason for our success. They always have our backs. We are constantly trying to figure out new cool things we can do for them. My manager Kevin Rondeau really prides himself and the band on our customer service. We want our fans to be happy because they have made our dreams come true time and time again.\n\nTaraleigh: They made them come true by selling out The Capitol Theatre recently. What were your first thoughts when you found out that the shows had sold out?\n\n Photo Credit Greg Horowitz Photography\n\nMihali: When we first heard that The Cap had sold out, we were all together pre-show in the green room rehearsing our song King Without a Crown. We all stopped. With huge smiles on our faces we gave each other some hugs and high fives and then realized it was game time and got right back down to rehearsing. There was a nervous excited energy buzzing around that green room from that moment on for sure.\n\nTaraleigh: I can only imagine what that was like for you guys. Can you describe how it felt after playing your first note to that sold out crowd? \n\nMihali: We opened the night with a new song Blunderbuss off of Plump Chapter Two. It felt so good to play in that room and even better to be playing a new song we all love. \n\nTaraleigh: If your music was an Muppet, which Muppet would it be and why?\n\nMihali: Haha! I think it would be many different ones because we have many different styles and influences that go into our music.  A little Kermit. Some Fozzy. Definitely Gonzo. Even Miss Piggy. They all have a place in our tunes.\n\nTaraleigh: How would your grandma describe Twiddle? \n\nMihali:. My grandma (Grandma Fox RIP) would probably say something like \"They are very talented, but it's a bit loud for my taste.\" (Said with a very proper British accent) I think my grandpa (Grandpa Fox RIP) would have really liked Twiddle. He had an amazing collection of music and also played mandolin and banjo. I have a very distinct memory of him listening to String Cheese Incident's version of Take Five. My brother Yianni and I had played for him and he loved it.\n\nTaraleigh: What are you most excited about right now? \n\n\n\n\nMihali:  Right now I am just excited about life in general. The music has been great and the band has been playing really well. We've been getting some amazing opportunities lately and the future is looking very bright. More than anything I am loving being a father. My daughter is the sweetest little girl ever and my wife is the strongest, greatest mother. They are everything to me and fill me with love and inspiration every single day. That's all I need to keep the creative juices flowing into the music. Life is really good right now and I've never been happier.\n\nTaraleigh: It's all happening. Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to share a little bit about yourself with me. See you at the Tumble Down if not sooner.\n\nThe awesome in me sees and bows to the awesome in you,\n\nTaraleigh\n\nMusic legend Oteil Burbridge and Taraleigh are hosting a retreat this fall that you can participate in from your own home.

      "content": "With 360 hp and a host of tweaks, the 2017 Macan GTS might be the most fun-to-drive crossover anyone's ever built.Zebulon Pike, the military commander and explorer for whom America's best-known mountain is named, never reached \"his\" peak, even though he tried. Over 200 years later, with a grin so giddy that I blame it on the thin air at 14,114 feet, I crested the summit of Pikes Peak a tick over 14 minutes after leaving the starting line. I was behind the wheel of the most fun-to-drive crossover anyone has ever built: the Porsche Macan GTS.<br />\n<br />\nI can't take credit for what must be one of the fastest unmodified sprints to the top. That goes to Pikes Peak legend Jeff Zwart, who led a pack of journalists in Porsche's latest Macan up the hugely demanding paved road. Zwart wasn't piloting a Macan GTS; instead, he was behind the wheel of the 911 GT2 he drove back in 2002 when much of the route was gravel. Today's pavement provides more grip but also less room for error, Zwart told us. <em>Unforgiving</em>, he called the mountain. That's just what you want to hear at 6:30 a.m. when Zwart, two cars in front of you, takes off at a racing start.<br />\n<br />\nPressed later, Zwart admitted he drove at a fraction of his racing pace while juggling two radios (one to communicate with us and one for park rangers to alert him to wildlife on the road) and shifting a manual transmission. Strapped into a Macan GTS, however, I found the trip plenty stressful &ndash; but that's because of the blind corners, the narrow road, the frost-heaved pavement, the blinding sun, and, of course, those <em>unforgiving</em> drop-offs. The polished GTS, which slots in between the mainstream Macan S and the bonkers Macan Turbo, proved unflappable.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"2017 Porsche Macan GTS\" class=\"grp-full\" data-credit=\"Porsch\" data-mep=\"1240322\" src=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/b792ae8777bea9f7c2992b97cc4bb6a1/203944045/20160609-a-1104-2b.jpg\" /><img class=\"grp-half\" data-credit=\"Porsche\" data-mep=\"1240335\" src=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/crop/2299x1295+5+0/resize/355x200!/format/jpg/quality/85/http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/dcf02bbcb517d7d6dbc525b991d56447/203944004/20160609-d-1349-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><img class=\"grp-half\" data-credit=\"Porsche\" data-mep=\"1240324\" src=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/crop/2299x1295+100+0/resize/355x200!/format/jpg/quality/85/http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/d61c70eca3c99e38d66aeb21c22e489c/203944000/20160609-b-3441-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n<br />\nOf the Macan flavors, which will soon include a four-cylinder base model, the GTS is best suited to carving through the Rockies. Its 3.0-liter, twin-turbo V6 comes from the Macan S, but Porsche dials its boost from 14 to 17.4 psi, bringing output to 360 horsepower at 6,000 rpm (up 20) and 369 pound-feet of torque from 1,650 to 4,000 rpm (up 30). The only gearbox available is the PDK (Porsche <em>Doppelkupplung</em>) seven-speed dual-clutch transmission with Comfort, Sport, and Sport Plus modes.<br />\n<br />\nIn addition to the power increase, the GTS gets a standard air suspension that sits 10 millimeters lower than the optional version for the S and the Turbo. Front brakes cribbed from the Turbo and a switchable sport exhaust with a single flapper valve round out the performance changes. Add the air suspension, 20-inch alloy wheels, and a few cosmetic goodies standard on the GTS to an S, and what was a $12,800 price difference becomes a more palatable $5,000 disparity.<br />\n<br />\nTo be honest, Pikes Peak didn't give us a real feel for the GTS's improvements. It can snow year round at the summit, so our test car was fitted with all-season rubber that inevitably dulled some steering feel and reduced at-the-limit grip. While the turbo helps compensate for the power losses at this altitude, there's considerable lag until that boost comes on.<br />\n<br />\nThe day didn't end there, though. We set off for Mt. Evans, the highest paved road in America next. My trek between Colorado's two most important peaks was more successful than ol' Zebulon's 1808 exploration of the Louisiana Purchase; Spaniards captured Pike and his men when they drifted into what was then New Spain. My route took the GTS over bumpy pavement and loose gravel along the Platte River; left in Comfort mode, the Macan GTS dutifully absorbed the irregular terrain with only a hint of stiffness.<br />\n<br />\n<img class=\"grp-full\" data-credit=\"Porsch\" data-mep=\"1240336\" src=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/16d8dee6860385f4f7ee92b96f22b92e/203944044/20160609-b-3364-2b.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><img class=\"grp-half\" data-credit=\"Porsche\" data-mep=\"1240337\" src=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/crop/2299x1295+182+0/resize/355x200!/format/jpg/quality/85/http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/ad5c58b6266cfc4db4d37347a0b25001/203943996/20160609-a-0967-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><img class=\"grp-half\" data-credit=\"Porsche\" data-mep=\"1240338\" src=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/dims-shared/dims3/GLOB/crop/2300x1296+99+0/resize/355x200!/format/jpg/quality/85/http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/ffd2e31ca4544401cc6abcc04cb459aa/203943998/20160609-b-3287-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe Macan GTS features a button marked Off Road that jacks the air suspension up an extra 10 millimeters. Nobody will intentionally push that button. Drivers will (and should) dial up Sport and Sport Plus. In those modes, the Macan corners with less lean yet manages to massage out road imperfections. The GTS's specifically tuned air suspension quickly revealed itself as the crossover's prime asset.<br />\n<br />\nDespite the setup's relative perfection, the GTS's nose still pushes into corners and its steering, although direct, can feel numb. These are the compromises that must be made to give the driver a seating position that towers over sports cars. The good news is that Porsche has largely avoided turning the GTS into a clone of the Audi SQ5. The Porsche, frankly, doesn't sound as good as the SQ5, but it hides its center of gravity better.<br />\n<br />\nWhile the Macan GTS has some minor flaws, the improvements over the S are appreciable. Together they bring the already terrific Macan even closer to the feeling of a Boxster on stilts. After all, we got to the top of the peak that Pike couldn't. Two mountains in one day, Porsche gloated.

      "plain_text": "With 360 hp and a host of tweaks, the 2017 Macan GTS might be the most fun-to-drive crossover anyone's ever built.Zebulon Pike, the military commander and explorer for whom America's best-known mountain is named, never reached \"his\" peak, even though he tried. Over 200 years later, with a grin so giddy that I blame it on the thin air at 14,114 feet, I crested the summit of Pikes Peak a tick over 14 minutes after leaving the starting line. I was behind the wheel of the most fun-to-drive crossover anyone has ever built: the Porsche Macan GTS.\n\n\n\nI can't take credit for what must be one of the fastest unmodified sprints to the top. That goes to Pikes Peak legend Jeff Zwart, who led a pack of journalists in Porsche's latest Macan up the hugely demanding paved road. Zwart wasn't piloting a Macan GTS; instead, he was behind the wheel of the 911 GT2 he drove back in 2002 when much of the route was gravel. Today's pavement provides more grip but also less room for error, Zwart told us. Unforgiving, he called the mountain. That's just what you want to hear at 6:30 a.m. when Zwart, two cars in front of you, takes off at a racing start.\n\n\n\nPressed later, Zwart admitted he drove at a fraction of his racing pace while juggling two radios (one to communicate with us and one for park rangers to alert him to wildlife on the road) and shifting a manual transmission. Strapped into a Macan GTS, however, I found the trip plenty stressful – but that's because of the blind corners, the narrow road, the frost-heaved pavement, the blinding sun, and, of course, those unforgiving drop-offs. The polished GTS, which slots in between the mainstream Macan S and the bonkers Macan Turbo, proved unflappable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the Macan flavors, which will soon include a four-cylinder base model, the GTS is best suited to carving through the Rockies. Its 3.0-liter, twin-turbo V6 comes from the Macan S, but Porsche dials its boost from 14 to 17.4 psi, bringing output to 360 horsepower at 6,000 rpm (up 20) and 369 pound-feet of torque from 1,650 to 4,000 rpm (up 30). The only gearbox available is the PDK (Porsche Doppelkupplung) seven-speed dual-clutch transmission with Comfort, Sport, and Sport Plus modes.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the power increase, the GTS gets a standard air suspension that sits 10 millimeters lower than the optional version for the S and the Turbo. Front brakes cribbed from the Turbo and a switchable sport exhaust with a single flapper valve round out the performance changes. Add the air suspension, 20-inch alloy wheels, and a few cosmetic goodies standard on the GTS to an S, and what was a $12,800 price difference becomes a more palatable $5,000 disparity.\n\n\n\nTo be honest, Pikes Peak didn't give us a real feel for the GTS's improvements. It can snow year round at the summit, so our test car was fitted with all-season rubber that inevitably dulled some steering feel and reduced at-the-limit grip. While the turbo helps compensate for the power losses at this altitude, there's considerable lag until that boost comes on.\n\n\n\nThe day didn't end there, though. We set off for Mt. Evans, the highest paved road in America next. My trek between Colorado's two most important peaks was more successful than ol' Zebulon's 1808 exploration of the Louisiana Purchase; Spaniards captured Pike and his men when they drifted into what was then New Spain. My route took the GTS over bumpy pavement and loose gravel along the Platte River; left in Comfort mode, the Macan GTS dutifully absorbed the irregular terrain with only a hint of stiffness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Macan GTS features a button marked Off Road that jacks the air suspension up an extra 10 millimeters. Nobody will intentionally push that button. Drivers will (and should) dial up Sport and Sport Plus. In those modes, the Macan corners with less lean yet manages to massage out road imperfections. The GTS's specifically tuned air suspension quickly revealed itself as the crossover's prime asset.\n\n\n\nDespite the setup's relative perfection, the GTS's nose still pushes into corners and its steering, although direct, can feel numb. These are the compromises that must be made to give the driver a seating position that towers over sports cars. The good news is that Porsche has largely avoided turning the GTS into a clone of the Audi SQ5. The Porsche, frankly, doesn't sound as good as the SQ5, but it hides its center of gravity better.\n\n\n\nWhile the Macan GTS has some minor flaws, the improvements over the S are appreciable. Together they bring the already terrific Macan even closer to the feeling of a Boxster on stilts. After all, we got to the top of the peak that Pike couldn't. Two mountains in one day, Porsche gloated. Seems like old Zeb would have been impressed.\n\n\n\nRelated Video:\n\n\n\n\n\n",
