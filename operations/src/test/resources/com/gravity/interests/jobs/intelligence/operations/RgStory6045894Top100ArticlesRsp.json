      "content": "(Reuters) - Students and faculty from the University of California, Los Angeles and the surrounding community will hold a second vigil on Friday to pay tribute to a professor who was gunned down in a murder-suicide committed by a former student. \nOn Thursday, hundreds gathered to grieve the loss of engineering professor William Klug who police say was shot and killed in a small office on campus on Wednesday by Mainak Sarkar, 38, who then took his own life. \n\"It will take time to cope and overcome the sadness that has cloaked our campus, but we will do it and we will do it together,\" said Danny Siegel, the president of the student council at UCLA during the vigil. \nThe base of UCLA's Bruin Bear statue on campus was covered with notes paying tribute to the well-liked professor as students completed finals and class work ahead of summer break. \nFriday's vigil will be held outside Boelter Hall where, police said, Sarkar came armed with two 9mm pistols and multiple ammunition clips to kill Klug. He also planned to kill another professor, who was off campus and unharmed. \nSarkar, a former UCLA student, shot dead a woman at her home in Minnesota before he drove almost 2,000 miles (3,200 km) to the school and killed Klug, police said. \nLos Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck told reporters on Thursday that a search of Sarkar's St. Paul, Minnesota, home turned up a \"kill list\" that included the name of the woman, Klug's name and the name of the other professor. \nOfficials would not release the name of the woman. Police said they found her body at a house in the 2400 block of Pearson Parkway in Brooklyn Park near Minneapolis. \nA marriage license application obtained by Reuters lists a residence on that block as the home of Ashley Erin Hasti and Sarkar, who married in Minnesota in 2011. \nNeighbors also said Hasti lived at the home. Records do not indicate whether the couple, who appeared to have been living separately, were divorced. \nAn active Facebook page belonging to a Minneapolis-area woman named Ashley Hasti shows pictures of Sarkar, but not more recently than May of 2011, about two weeks before their marriage. \nA page apparently belonging to him, with no public posts since 2011, still prominently displayed several photos of them together. \nSarkar came from India's eastern state of West Bengal, where he graduated in aerospace engineering from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology at Kharagpur in 2000, according to an ex-classmate and the university's alumni list. \nStaff at his secondary school in the industrial town of Durgapur remember him as an able student who passed his exams with good results. \n",

      "content": "CALIFORNIA, U.S. - The UCLA gunman who killed a professor before turning the gun on himself, left behind a kill list. He is also suspected of having shot and killed a woman in Minnesota. \nAccording to reports, the assailant Mainak Sarkar, aged 38, was a former doctoral candidate and a resident of Minnesota. \nLAPD Chief Charlie Beck on June 2 said that Sarkar left behind a list at his house which included the names of a woman, UCLA professor William Klug and a second professor who is said to be safe. \nSarkar had accused Klug of stealing his computer code and giving it to someone else. \nPolice officials went to the woman’s house, whose name was on the list, at Brooklyn Park, Minnesota. According to public records, the resident listed for the house was Ashley Hasti. \nPolice found a woman who was deceased of an apparent gunshot wound and reports quoted Hennepin County Vital Records that showed that the woman had married Sarkar on June 14, 2011. \nIt is, however, unclear whether they were married when Sarkar went on a rampage. \nAccording to reports, detectives who arrived at Klug’s office after the shooting found two bodies and a note from Sarkar in which he had written down his address and asked someone to “check on my cat.” \nBeck said, “Immediately we were highly suspicious. That made me uneasy about what we would find when we got to Minnesota.” \nAt Sarkar’s home, the LAPD found extra ammunition and a box for one of the guns found at UCLA. \nThe woman’s body was found after midnight on June 2 by the Brooklyn Park Police. \nThe deputy police chief, at a press conference, said that the woman had been dead for a couple of days. \nHe added, “We have multiple detectives working on this case. We’re working with LAPD to coordinate our efforts.” \nOn June 1, Sarkar carried a backpack, two semi-automatic pistols, extra magazines, and went to Klug’s office where he killed the professor and himself. \nBeck said the gunman “was certainly prepared to engage multiple victims.” \nSarkar’s list also mentioned another professor. \nBeck said, “We believe… that he went to kill two faculty from UCLA. He was only able to locate one.” \nThe second professor who was on campus during the shooting has said that he knew that Sarkar had issues with him. \n",

      "content": "Los Angeles: The gunman who killed a UCLA professor before committing suicide on campus left behind a \"kill list\" and is suspected in the shooting death of a woman in Minnesota, authorities said. \nMainak Sarkar, 38, a former doctoral student and Minnesota resident, left a list at his home in that state that included the names of the woman, UCLA professor William Klug and a second professor who is safe, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said on Thursday. Sarkar shot Klug multiple times in a small office in UCLA Engineering Building 4 before taking his own life, authorities said. \nMainak Sarkar with Ashley Hasti Photo: Facebook \nSarkar had accused Klug of stealing his computer code and giving it to someone else, according to police. \nAuthorities declined to name the woman in Minnesota. \nOn Thursday, police in Brooklyn Park, Minneosta, strung crime scene tape around a gray split-level home on Pearson Parkway. Property records listed the resident at the home as Ashley Hasti. \nA SWAT officer searches a student who was evacuated from the UCLA campus on the day of the fatal shooting. Photo: AP \nWhen detectives arrived at Klug's office on Wednesday morning and found both bodies, they also found a note from Sarkar listing his home address in Minnesota and asking someone to \"check on my cat.\" \n\"Immediately we were highly suspicious,\" Beck told the Los Angeles Times. \"That made me uneasy about what we would find when we got to Minnesota.\" \nThe LAPD worked with the FBI and Minnesota authorities and served a search warrant at Sarkar's home, Beck said. Inside, they found extra ammunition and a box for one of two pistols found at UCLA, as well as the \"kill list\" with the three names, the chief said. \nLos Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck comments on the investigation into a murder-suicide on the UCLA campus. Photo: AP \nAuthorities went to the woman's home in Brooklyn Park, a Minneapolis suburb, and found her body just after midnight Thursday, police said. \nIt appeared she had been dead of a gunshot wound for \"maybe a couple of days,\" Beck said. \nBeck declined to name the woman but said Sarkar was suspected in her death. \nVictim Bill Klug, a professor of mechanical engineering. Photo: AP \n\"We would physically arrest him were he still alive,\" the chief said. \nSarkar drove from Minnesota to Los Angeles, according to Beck, but it was unclear how long he was in LA before Wednesday's shooting. Detectives don't think it was \"more than a couple of days,\" the chief said. \nOn Wednesday, Sarkar carried a backpack, two semiautomatic pistols and extra magazines to Klug's fourth-floor office, where he fatally shot the professor before turning the gun on himself, Beck said. \nKlug, 39, was an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering. Sarkar had accused him of stealing his computer code and giving it to someone else, according to police. A source called the gunman's accusations \"absolutely untrue.\" \nKlug had been the target of Sarkar's anger on social media for months. On March 10, Sarkar called the professor a \"very sick person\" who could not be trusted. \n\"William Klug, UCLA professor is not the kind of person when you think of a professor,\" Sarkar wrote. \"He is a very sick person. I urge every new student coming to UCLA to stay away from this guy,\" Sarkar wrote. \"He made me really sick. Your enemy is my enemy. But your friend can do a lot more harm. Be careful about whom you trust.\" \nKlug, who was described by friends as a kind and caring man, worked diligently to help Sarkar finish his dissertation and graduate, even though the quality of Sarkar's work was not stellar, one source said. \n\"Bill was extremely generous to this student, who was a subpar student,\" the person said. \nIn his doctoral dissertation, submitted in 2013, Sarkar expressed gratitude to Klug for his help and support. A syllabus from 2010 lists Sarkar as one of two teaching assistant s in a mechanical and aerospace engineering course, MAE: 101: Statics and Strength of Materials. Sarkar was listed in the 2014 doctoral commencement booklet with Klug as his adviser. \nIt is not immediately clear, Beck said, whether Sarkar tried to find the other professor on his list. The second professor, whom Beck did not name, was not on campus at the time of the shooting. Police have been in contact with that person, who \"is fine,\" the chief said. \nInvestigators are trying to determine Sarkar's actions in recent days, particularly his drive from Minnesota, Beck said. Police are searching for Sarkar's car, a 2003 gray Nissan Sentra, with Minnesota license plate 720KTW. \nBeck said police don't expect the vehicle to be \"any significant danger,\" but officials have asked anyone who sees it to call police. \nBefore enrolling at UCLA, Sarkar earned a master's degree at Stanford University following an undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur, according to his LinkedIn page. In the US, he also had a stint as a research assistant at the University of Texas and worked as a software developer. \nAfter UCLA, Sarkar worked remotely as an engineering analyst for an Ohio-based rubber company, Endurica LLC. Will Mars, the company's president, confirmed to the Times that Sarkar worked for Endurica until August 2014. He declined to provide more details. \nOn Wednesday, thousands of students and UCLA staff members found themselves racing to barricade classroom doors with desks, projectors and anything else they could find after cellphones buzzed across campus with alerts of a possible shooting. \nBy 12:05pm, police confirmed that two men had been killed in an engineering building. \nThe campus was declared safe, and UCLA officials lifted a lockdown that had cancelled classes for the day. \n",

      "content": "LOS ANGELES, CA - UCLA engineering professor William Klug, who was killed by a former graduate student in his office, was remembered today by the university's chancellor as a dedicated faculty member who brought \"wonderful gifts and talents\" to the Westwood campus. \nPolice said Klug, 39, was shot around 10 a.m. Wednesday by former student Mainak Sarkar in an office in UCLA's Boelter Hall. Sarkar then turned the gun on himself. \n\"Our entire UCLA family is mourning the loss of Professor Klug, a respected, dedicated and caring faculty member,\" UCLA Chancellor Gene Block wrote in a statement released to the university community. \"At this time, our thoughts and prayers are with Professor Klug's wife, Mary Elise, his two children, his extended family, friends and colleagues. Let us remember and be grateful for the wonderful gifts and talents Professor Klug shared with us at UCLA.\" \nAccording to the university, Klug attended UCLA as a graduate student in 1998-99, when he earned a master's degree in civil engineering. After earning his doctorate from Caltech in 2003, he returned to UCLA and joined the faculty at the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science. He was promoted to a full professor in 2015. \nHe specialized in \"computational biomechanics and the mechanics of biological systems, such as cancer cells.\" He was most recently working with the UCLA Cardiac Modeling Group, using biometrics to help understand the electromechanics of the heart. He previously worked on a project aimed at better picture of the physics of cells, helping to understand the life cycles of viruses, including HIV. \nHe was the director of the Klug Research Group, which studied computational biomechanics, such as how the shape and mechanics of biological structures affect their function. \nKlug received a 2008 National Science Foundation Career Award of $475,000, and received a Samueli Teaching Award in 2007. During a sabbatical in 2012, he was a visiting scholar at both Caltech and USC. \n\"Bill was one of the most talented, intelligent and caring people I have ever known, and he made enormous contributions in the field of computational biomechanics,\" according to UCLA professor Jeff Eldredge, who studied with Klug at Caltech. \"While sharing a lab with him these past 13 years, I have watched him mentor a series of great research students. I had looked forward to us growing into old grouchy professors together, and I'm very sad to lose a dear friend and colleague and the many years of future collaboration and camaraderie that have vanished for no sensible reason. We have lost someone truly special.\" \nKlug is survived by his wife, Mary Elise; and children Timothy, 9, and Rosemary, 7. A GoFundMe page has been established to help Klug's family with funeral expenses. \nIn addition to a vigil planned for 8:30 p.m. tonight at Bruin Plaza, the UCLA engineering school will hold a vigil at 4 p.m. Friday at the UCLA Court of Sciences. \n",

Klug , 39, was an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering. \nThe Los Angeles Police Department ruled his death a murder-suicide, according to Reuters. \nThe news shocked friends and colleagues, who described Klug as kind and brilliant. \n\"I am absolutely devastated,\" Alan Garfinkel, another professor at UCLA, told The Los Angeles Times. “You cannot ask for a nicer, gentler, sweeter, and more supportive guy than William Klug.\" \nUCLA colleague Jim Gimzewski tearfully told The Associated Press that Klug was a \"kind, gentle soul with a brilliant mind.\" \nKlug was a married father of two, who leaves behind a son, 10, and daughter, 7. He was a devoted member of his El Segundo, California, community, where he coached his son's Little League Baseball team. \n\"Today there's a hole in the heart of El Segundo Little League,\" Peter Gianusso, president of the El Segundo Little League, told the AP. \"They really can't believe it because Bill was one of the kindest, most lighthearted, quiet person that you'd ever meet.\" \nFormer students of Klug's were similarly distressed over the news of his death. \n\"I'm outraged,\" Renjie Li, a student of Klug's, told the AP. \"When I took his class last year, I always went to his office hours and asked a bunch of questions, and he always answered with passion.\" \nKlug earned a master's degree in civil engineering from UCLA and and a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from Caltech. \nUCLA held a vigil for Klug, and the El Segundo community held a memorial service on Wednesday night, according to local station KTLA. \nA GoFundMe page with a goal of $100,000 was created on Wednesday. \n\" His family was the most important thing to him, and our goal is to make sure they are taken care of now and in the future,\" it reads. \n",

      "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) - The Latest on a murder-suicide at UCLA (all times local): \nThe man who carried out the UCLA murder-suicide wrote a dissertation in which he thanked the professor he fatally shot. \nThe 2013 dissertation by Mainak Sarkar includes two lines about professor William Klug. It says: \"I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. William Klug, for all his help and support. Thank you for being my mentor.\" \nThe document thanks several other professors and three friends, with Sarkar saying, \"I will always remember all the good time we had together.\" \nThe dissertation, approved by Klug and four colleagues, is dedicated to Sarkar's dead mother, Ira Sarkar. It's titled, \"Coupled Cardiac Electrophysiology and Contraction using Finite Element.\" \nLos Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said Thursday that Sarkar drove from his home in Saint Paul, Minnesota to kill Klug and another professor named in a \"kill list\" found in Sarkar's home. Sarkar killed himself after killing Klug. The other professor named is safe. \nA woman on the \"kill list\" was found dead in her home outside Saint Paul, and authorities say it appears she was killed before the UCLA shooting. \nThe Los Angeles police chief says a note about a cat at the scene of the UCLA murder-suicide led to the discovery of a so-called kill list and a dead woman's body in Minnesota. \nThe note was found Wednesday after Mainak Sarkar killed engineering professor Bill Klug and then himself in Klug's office. \nBeck says the note requested that the finder check on a cat at Sarkar's residence in St. Paul, Minnesota. \nAt the residence, investigators found a so-called kill list with the names of two professors and a woman living in Brooklyn Park outside St. Paul. \nLocal police found the woman's body and believe she was killed before the UCLA shooting. \nPolice believe Sarkar also intended to kill the other professor, who was off campus at the time. \nThe Los Angeles police chief says investigators believe the man who carried out the UCLA murder-suicide went to the campus to kill two professors. \nChief Charlie Beck says the second professor was off campus Wednesday when Mainak Sarkar (MY'-nahk SUR'-kahr) arrived armed with two guns and many rounds of ammunition. \nSarkar killed engineering professor Bill Klug and then killed himself. \nBeck says the other professor's name turned up in a \"kill list\" discovered in Sarkar's Minnesota residence. \nA woman also named on that list was found dead early Thursday of an apparent gunshot at her Minnesota home. \nA blog post that appears to be written by a man who carried out a murder-suicide at UCLA calls the victim of the crime a \"sick guy.\" \nThe blog, posted in March by a man identifying himself as Mainak Sarkar (MY'-nahk SUR'-kahr), says he and UCLA Professor Bill Klug had personal differences. \nThe blog accuses Klug of stealing Sarkar's intellectual property and giving it to another student and says \"he made me really sick.\" \nIt ends with: \"Your enemy is your enemy. But your friend can do a lot more harm. Be careful about whom you trust.\" \nLos Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck told KTLA-TV on Wednesday that the motive of the UCLA shooting was tied to Sarkar's belief that Klug released his intellectual property. Beck says UCLA asserts it was all in Sarkar's imagination. \nFamily and friends of Klug describe him as a kind, gentle man who didn't appear to have conflicts with anyone. \nPolice in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, say they found a dead woman when Los Angeles police asked them to conduct a welfare check at a local address in connection with the UCLA murder-suicide investigation. \nA Brooklyn Park police statement says officers responded early Thursday and found the woman dead of an apparent gunshot wound. \nThe statement says early indications are that the woman's shooting happened before the UCLA shooting, which occurred at midmorning Wednesday. \nLos Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck tells KTLA-TV that a \"kill list\" was found in the Minnesota home of UCLA shooter Mainak Sarkar. \nThe list contained the names of UCLA engineering professor Bill Klug, who was slain in the murder-suicide, another UCLA professor, and the Minnesota woman. Beck says the other UCLA professor is OK. \nThe Los Angeles police chief says the man who carried out a murder-suicide at UCLA left a \"kill list\" at his Minnesota home that led authorities to find a woman's dead body. \nSpeaking on KTLA-TV, Chief Charlie Beck says Mainak Sarkar drove to Los Angeles from Minnesota with two guns and killed Professor William Klug before killing himself. \nBeck says when authorities searched Sarkar's home in Minnesota, they found a \"kill list\" with the names of Klug, another UCLA professor and a woman. \nBeck says the woman was found shot dead in her home in a nearby Minnesota town. The other professor on the list is alright. \nBeck says it appears that mental issues were involved and says Sarkar's dispute with Klug appears to be tied to Sarkar thinking the professor released intellectual property that harmed Sarkar. \nPolice are asking the public's help to find the car Sarkar drove to Los Angeles, a 2003 Nissan Sentra with the license plate of 720KTW. \nLos Angeles police have identified the man they say carried out a murder-suicide on the UCLA campus. \nA police spokeswoman, Officer Jenny Houser, says the gunman was Mainak Sarkar. \nSarkar gunned down mechanical engineering professor William Klug in an office Wednesday before taking his own life. \nThe shooting triggered a huge police response until authorities determined there was no continuing threat. \nClasses are resuming Thursday except for the engineering department, which will reopen next week. \n",

Sarkar then turned the gun on himself. \n\"Our entire UCLA family is mourning the loss of Professor Klug, a respected, dedicated and caring faculty member,\" UCLA Chancellor Gene Block wrote in a statement released to the university community. \"At this time, our thoughts and prayers are with Professor Klug's wife, Mary Elise, his two children, his extended family, friends and colleagues. Let us remember and be grateful for the wonderful gifts and talents Professor Klug shared with us at UCLA.\" \nAccording to the university, Klug attended UCLA as a graduate student in 1998-99, when he earned a master's degree in civil engineering. After earning his doctorate from Caltech in 2003, he returned to UCLA and joined the faculty at the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science.

      "content": "The man suspected of shooting and killing a UCLA professor Wednesday before turning the gun on himself is also the suspect in another homicide that police believe occurred before the campus shooting, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck said today. \nPolice identified the gunman as former UCLA student Mainak Sarkar. Beck said that Sarkar, who earned a Ph.D. from the school in 2013, was \"heavily armed.\" \nInvestigators found two semiautomatic guns on him at the scene of the crime. Both were legally purchased. \nSarkar had a note on him requesting that whoever found the note check on his cat; it then listed his Minnesota address. \nObtained by ABCNews \nBeck said today that police believe Sarkar drove to Los Angeles in \"the last couple of days\" before the shooting. \nWhen police searched his home, they found a list with the names of three people: two UCLA professors and a Minnesota woman. One of the professors, William Klug, was the shooting victim on Wednesday; the other was off campus and was unharmed. \nThe woman, who has not been publicly identified, was found dead of a gunshot wound at her residence in a town near St. Paul, where Sarkar lived. \nClassroom Doors That Don't Lock Add to UCLA Shooting Scare \nUCLA Professor Killed in Murder-Suicide on Campus \nBrooklyn Park police in Minnesota said today that they were notified by the LAPD and asked to go check on someone in relation to the UCLA shooting. \"Upon arrival, officers located one adult female deceased from an apparent gunshot wound. Early indications are the shooting occurred prior to the UCLA event,\" the Brooklyn Park police said in a statement. \nIn Klug's slaying, investigators are focusing on Sarkar's grades and what was described as a longer-standing poor relationship between the two men. The LAPD said it believes Klug was one of Sarkar's teachers. \nBeck also told reporters today that he was aware of a social media post that Sarkar allegedly wrote to bash Klug. But Beck said that the posts he has reviewed \"contained no death threats. There [was] some harsh language\" but \"certainly nothing that would be considered homicidal.\" \nAs for the second professor on the list, he was aware that \"Sarkar had issues with him,\" Beck said, but didn't believe it would reach \"the level of homicide.\" \n\"I don't think either of them expected to see him,\" Beck said of the two professors. \nUCLA confirmed that Sarkar was a graduate student there from the fall of 2007 until the summer of 2013, when he received a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from the school. \nKlug joined the UCLA faculty in 2003 and headed an eponymous research group that studied theoretical and computational biomechanics. The school said he is survived by his wife and their two children. \nInvestigators worked through the night to understand what happened and why. Beck said today that Sarkar's motive may be connected to a dispute over intellectual property, which UCLA has denied. \n",

      "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) - The investigation into a murder-suicide on the UCLA campus took a more sinister turn Thursday when police announced they suspected the shooter earlier killed a woman in Minnesota then drove to Los Angeles to confront a professor he believed had stolen his work. \nDetectives also believe that Mainak Sarkar, a 38-year-old former engineering graduate student, intended to kill a second professor Wednesday morning, but he could not find him on campus, Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck said. \nIn a search of Sarkar's home in St. Paul, Minnesota, authorities found a \"kill list\" with at least three names that included professor Bill Klug, the woman found dead in a Minneapolis suburb and a second UCLA professor who was not harmed, Beck said. \nSarkar shot and killed Klug in a UCLA engineering building, leading to a lockdown on the campus with 60,000 or more students and staff members. He then fatally shot himself. \nSarkar drove to Los Angeles from Minnesota with two guns and ammunition before he killed Klug. \nHe left a note at the scene of the killing that asked anyone who found it to check on a cat at his home in Minnesota, Beck told reporters. It was there that authorities found the \"kill list,\" which led them to a home in a nearby town, where they found the woman shot dead. \nShe was not identified and authorities didn't release how Sarkar knew her. \nBeck said it appeared mental issues were involved and that Sarkar's dispute with Klug was tied to Sarkar thinking the professor released intellectual property that harmed Sarkar. \nA blog post written in March by someone identifying himself as Sarkar said he had personal differences with Klug. \n\"He cleverly stole all my code and gave it (to) another student,\" the post says. \"He made me really sick.\" \nThe blog continues: \"Your enemy is your enemy. But your friend can do a lot more harm. Be careful about whom you trust. Stay away from this sick guy.\" \nBeck said UCLA asserts it was all in Sarkar's imagination. \nSarkar is listed on a UCLA website as a member of a computational biomechanics research group run by Klug, a professor of mechanical engineering. \nPolice were working Thursday to find the car Sarkar drove to Los Angeles and sought the public's help. \nClasses at the University of California, Los Angeles campus resumed Thursday for most of the school, except for the engineering department, where students and faculty will return Monday. \nKlug's colleagues and friends described him as a kind, devoted family man and teacher who didn't appear to have conflicts with anyone. \n\"Bill was an absolutely wonderful man, just the nicest guy you would ever want to meet,\" said a collaborator, UCLA Professor Alan Garfinkel. The two worked together to build a computer model of the heart, a \"50 million variable 'virtual heart' that could be used to test drugs.\" \nInitial reports from the scene set off widespread fears of an attempted mass shooting on campus, bringing a response of hundreds of heavily armed officers. Groups of them stormed into buildings that were locked down and cleared hallways as police helicopters hovered overhead. \nAdvised by university text alerts to turn off lights and lock doors where they were, many students let friends and family know they were safe in social media posts. Some described frantic evacuation scenes, while others wrote that their doors weren't locking and posted photos of photocopiers and foosball tables they used as barricades. \nThose locked down inside classrooms described a nervous calm. Some said they had to rig the doors closed with whatever was at hand. \nUmar Rehman, 21, was in a math sciences classroom adjacent to Engineering IV, the building where the shooting took place. The buildings are connected by walkway bridges near the center of the 419-acre campus. \n\"We kept our eye on the door. We knew that somebody eventually could come,\" he said, acknowledging his terror. \nThe door would not lock and those in the room devised a plan to hold it closed using a belt and crowbar, and demand ID from anyone who tried to get in. \nScott Waugh, an executive vice chancellor and provost, said the university would look into concerns about doors that would not lock. \nOne student who spent hours sheltering in a building did the same thing almost exactly two years ago when he was locked down in a dorm at UC Santa Barbara during a shooting rampage in the surrounding neighborhood that left six students dead and 13 people wounded. \nJeremy Peschard, 21, said it was \"eerily similar\" but that having been through the feeling of crisis before left him almost numb. \n\"I just felt a little bit less shocked, a little bit less taken aback by the reality of an active shooter on a college campus,\" he told The Associated Press in an email. \"Because I feel like this is the day and age we're living in, that college campus shootings have genuinely become a normalized threat, almost like a natural disaster, except this type of destruction isn't natural. It's just really sad.\" \n",

      "content": "After a former graduate student killed a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and took his own life Wednesday, professors and gun rights advocates are highlighting one aspect of the concealed carry debate, with both sides saying their stance could save lives: whether licensed carry holders should be able to bring their weapons on campus, and into faculty offices in particular. \nOpponents, including university staff, say allowing guns into professors' offices will put them in danger of being alone with a disgruntled, armed student, which was reportedly the case on the southern California campus. Concealed carry advocates, however, say the murder-suicide emphasizes why professors should be able to protect themselves. \n\"If this premeditated shooting at UCLA calls any policies or laws into question, it is the policies and laws denying law-abiding professors the means to defend themselves where they're most vulnerable,\" Students for Concealed Carry said in a statement it shared with The Christian Science Monitor. Licensed adults should have \"the same measure of personal protection on campus that they're allowed virtually everywhere else,\" it said. \nRecommended: Arizona shooting: US has lots of guns, but it's not alone \nOn Wednesday, former UCLA doctoral student Mainak Sarkar killed William Klug, an engineering professor and Mr. Sarkar's adviser, in an office on campus , then killed himself. Dr. Sarkar had accused Dr. Klug of stealing his computer code and giving it to someone else, and had lashed out at his former adviser on social media for months, according to the Los Angeles Times. \nStudents and staff were alerted to an \"active shooter\" on campus, and barricaded themselves in classrooms as police and firefighters swarmed UCLA. Klug, one of two professors on a \"kill list\" police found in Sarkar's home in Minnesota, was the only victim; the other professor, now safe, was off-campus at the time of the shooting. \nAccording to police, Sarkar drove from Minnesota to California with two semiautomatic handguns in his sedan. He is also suspected of fatally shooting a woman in a Minneapolis suburb before making the trip, according to the LA Times. \nCalifornia, which already has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, tightened its \"campus carry\" law in October. It is illegal to possess a firearm within 1,000 feet of a campus or school in the Golden State without permission from the administration. Previously, however, those with concealed carry permits were excluded from this restriction. Senate Bill 707, which Gov. Jerry Brown signed this fall, closed that exemption, making current and retired law enforcement officers the only people allowed to bring firearms near or on campus. \nEight states currently allow \"campus carry,\" allowing licensed concealed carry holders to bring their weapons on campus , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Texas will become the ninth state in August, once a law requiring the state's 14 public universities to allow concealed carry license holders to bring handguns into campus buildings and classrooms becomes effective. \nEach Texas public university can draft policies about campus carry before it becomes effective this summer, such as the creation of gun-free zones. In May, the president of the University of Texas System regents proposed allowing faculty to ban guns from their offices , amid professors' fears about students entering their offices armed. \nConcealed carry turns \"every interaction on campus into potentially one that involves a weapon,\" Ian Bogost, a Georgia Tech University professor who earned his PhD from UCLA, tells the Monitor. Dr. Bogost shared his Texas colleagues' concerns when the Georgia Legislature passed a bill to allow campus carry. The bill was vetoed by Gov. Nathan Deal, however. \n\"Your office is the one place for a professor to sort of feel safe, to ensconce yourself there and be cloistered – whether those things are violence, noise or colleagues,\" he says in a phone interview. \"When I saw the news of [UCLA], this is exactly the nightmare scenario for any professor.\" \n\"The nightmare scenario is a student of mine, unstable or otherwise dissatisfied, tries to do me harm in a private space,\" he says, suggesting that students are under more \"enormous pressure\" with grades and other \"arbitrary measurements of success\" than ever. \nAndy Pelosi, executive director of Campaign to Keep Guns Off Campus, tells the Monitor that Bogost's and Texas professors' concerns about \"disgruntled\" students are one his organization has heard in other states, including Idaho. Asked if a campus shooting in California, with such strict gun laws, reinforces the need for professors and students to be able to arm themselves, he says that's not the answer. \n\"When it comes to campus carry, our view is it increases the risk,\" he says. \"If people are concerned about safety on campus, and it's a legitimate concern, let's look at other avenues to increase safety – campus security, escorts, safer doors – that have been done and could be done.\" \nBut for some on-campus gun advocates, completely safety-centric debates miss a main point. \n\"The question isn't whether it lowers on-campus crime rates or serves as a deterrent to crime,\" Students for Concealed Carry write on the group's website, \"the question is whether there is justification to deny licensees on campus the same measure of self-defense they enjoy at movie theaters, shopping malls, churches, and museums. \n",

      "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \" The Latest on a murder-suicide at UCLA (all times local): 11:10 a.m. The Los Angeles police chief says investigators believe the man who carried out the UCLA murder-suicide went to the campus to kill two professors. Chief Charlie Beck says the second professor was off campus Wednesday when Mainak Sarkar (MY'-nahk SUR'-kahr) arrived armed with two guns and many rounds of ammunition. Sarkar killed engineering professor Bill Klug and then killed himself. Beck says the other professor's name turned up in a \"kill list\" discovered in Sarkar's Minnesota residence. A woman also named on that list was found dead early Thursday of an apparent gunshot at her Minnesota home. ___ 10:10 a.m. A blog post that appears to be written by a man who carried out a murder-suicide at UCLA calls the victim of the crime a \"sick guy.\" The blog, posted in March by a man identifying himself as Mainak Sarkar (MY'-nahk SUR'-kahr), says he and UCLA Professor Bill Klug had personal differences. The blog accuses Klug of stealing Sarkar's intellectual property and giving it to another student and says \"he made me really sick.\" It ends with: \"Your enemy is your enemy. But your friend can do a lot more harm. Be careful about whom you trust.\" Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck told KTLA-TV on Wednesday that the motive of the UCLA shooting was tied to Sarkar's belief that Klug released his intellectual property. Beck says UCLA asserts it was all in Sarkar's imagination. Family and friends of Klug describe him as a kind, gentle man who didn't appear to have conflicts with anyone. ___ 9:45 a.m. Police in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, say they found a dead woman when Los Angeles police asked them to conduct a welfare check at a local address in connection with the UCLA murder-suicide investigation. A Brooklyn Park police statement says officers responded early Thursday and found the woman dead of an apparent gunshot wound. The statement says early indications are that the woman's shooting happened before the UCLA shooting, which occurred at midmorning Wednesday. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck tells KTLA-TV that a \"kill list\" was found in the Minnesota home of UCLA shooter Mainak Sarkar. The list contained the names of UCLA engineering professor Bill Klug, who was slain in the murder-suicide, another UCLA professor, and the Minnesota woman. Beck says the other UCLA professor is OK. ___ 9 a.m. The Los Angeles police chief says the man who carried out a murder-suicide at UCLA left a \"kill list\" at his Minnesota home that led authorities to find a woman's dead body. Speaking on KTLA-TV, Chief Charlie Beck says Mainak Sarkar drove to Los Angeles from Minnesota with two guns and killed Professor William Klug before killing himself. Beck says when authorities searched Sarkar's home in Minnesota, they found a \"kill list\" with the names of Klug, another UCLA professor and a woman. Beck says the woman was found shot dead in her home in a nearby Minnesota town. The other professor on the list is alright. Beck says it appears that mental issues were involved and says Sarkar's dispute with Klug appears to be tied to Sarkar thinking the professor released intellectual property that harmed Sarkar. Police are asking the public's help to find the car Sarkar drove to Los Angeles, a 2003 Nissan Sentra with the license plate of 720KTW. ___ 7:15 a.m. Los Angeles police have identified the man they say carried out a murder-suicide on the UCLA campus. A police spokeswoman, Officer Jenny Houser, says the gunman was Mainak Sarkar. Sarkar gunned down mechanical engineering professor William Klug in an office Wednesday before taking his own life. The shooting triggered a huge police response until authorities determined there was no continuing threat. Classes are resuming Thursday except for the engineering department, which will reopen next week. \n",

      "content": "Los Angeles, Jun 1 (EFE).  The gunman in the UCLA murdersuicide earlier this week has been identified as Mainak Sarkar, a former student of the professor who was shot to death, police said. \nAccording to authorities, Sarkar had been spending the past few months posting messages on the social networks against the professor, whom he accused of having stolen computer code he had created and giving it to another person. \nOn March 10, Sarkar said that the Prof. William Klug was \"a very sick person\" whom he did not trust. \n\"William Klug, UCLA professor is not the kind of person when you think of a professor. He is a very sick person. I urge every new student coming to UCLA to stay away from this guy,\" Sarkar wrote, according to the Los Angeles Times. \n\"He made me really sick. Your enemy is your enemy. But your friend can do a lot more harm. Be careful about whom you trust,\" he added. \nThe former student on Wednesday entered the engineering building at UCLA and murdered Klug, a mechanical and aerospace engineering professor, before ending his own life. \nUniversity officials consulted by the Times said that Sarkar's accusations are \"absolutely false.\" \nThe sources said that Sarkar would have to be completely \"psychotic\" to think that someone would steal his ideas. \nLos Angeles police chief Charlie Beck confirmed on Wednesday that the two fatalities were men and that the authorities had found a note next to one of their bodies, but he did not say if it was a confession or a suicide note. \nThe UCLA campus was locked down for about two hours starting at 10 a.m. while authorities organized a heavy police deployment with dozens of officers scouring the grounds to find the shooter, any accomplices he may have had and any victims. \nStudents were evacuated from certain areas and relocated elsewhere, the university said. \nThe FBI sent agents to the campus, while the LAPD declared a \"tactical alert\" in the city and deployed hundreds of police at the university and its environs. \n",

      "content": "Investigators in Los Angeles are still searching for a motive in Wednesday's murder-suicide at the UCLA campus. \nSources identify the gunman as Mainak Sarkar. CBS News has confirmed that he used a 9mm semi-automatic pistol to kill 39-year-old engineering professor William Scott Klug in an office, before taking his own life. \nUCLA officials are also reviewing safety protocols as the shooting revealed a problem with the doors on campus, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans. \nStudents in the midst of finals week filed out of classrooms and buildings with their hands raised. \n\"Then there was a police officer and he was like yelling at us to get out, get out, with a machine gun,\" said a witness. \nOne student posted images of police inside the building, going door to door with guns drawn. \nStudents and staff were instructed to find a secure place as hundreds of LAPD officers, the FBI and the ATF responded to the 30,000-student campus. But without proper locks, students were forced to improvise, using chairs, power chords and a foosball table to make sure no one could enter. \n— Jason Schechter (@Jasonschechter) June 1, 2016 \n— Carrie Rapaport ️ (@newt_ripley) June 1, 2016 \n\"But our doors open outward so it was very hard to try to lock it because it didn't have a lock,\" said UCLA student Lauren Robinson. \nUCLA Provost Scott Waugh said the school is now aware of the issue and and plans on addressing. \n\"We'll review the locks on the doors and any security issue that has arisen during the course of today,\" Waugh said. \nA law enforcement source said Sarkar, the deceased shooting suspect, used a 9mm semi-automatic and had no apparent criminal history, reports CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton. \nPolice recovered at least one gun and a note at the scene. \n\"There is evidence there... that could be a suicide note but we do not know that at this point,\" said LAPD Police Chief Charlie Beck. \nFriends and family are remembering the victim, William Klug - a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and a husband and father of two young children, who coached his son's little league team. \nThe team took the field Wednesday without their coach. Parents said it's what Klug would have wanted. \n\"It's hard to even fathom to have your... son grow up without a dad, is rough,\" said Lance Giroux, Klug's friend. \"So I'm hoping the community here can kind of rally around that.\" \nEngineering classes are now canceled for the rest of the week at UCLA, but the rest of the school will operate as normal. \nThe college students were not the only ones in danger Wednesday - 19 second graders were reportedly visiting the campus when the lockdown happened. \n",

The other professor on the list is alright. \nBeck says it appears that mental issues were involved and says Sarkar's dispute with Klug appears to be tied to Sarkar thinking the professor released intellectual property that harmed Sarkar. \nPolice are asking the public's help to find the car Sarkar drove to Los Angeles, a 2003 Nissan Sentra with the license plate of 720KTW. \nLos Angeles police have identified the man they say carried out a murder-suicide on the UCLA campus. \nA police spokeswoman, Officer Jenny Houser, says the gunman was Mainak Sarkar. \nSarkar gunned down mechanical engineering professor William Klug in an office Wednesday before taking his own life. \nThe shooting triggered a huge police response until authorities determined there was no continuing threat. \nClasses are resuming Thursday except for the engineering department, which will reopen next week. \n",

      "content": "Los Angeles (CNN)Police found a “kill list” at the Minnesota home of the gunman who opened fire at UCLA on Wednesday, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck told CNN affiliate KTLA-TV. \nThe name of the UCLA professor killed by gunman Mainak Sarkar was on the list, as was the name of a woman whom police later found dead, Beck said. \n“We did a follow-up investigation to that female’s residence in a nearby town in Minnesota and found her deceased by gunshot wound,” Beck said. \nUCLA identified the slain professor as William S. Klug. \nThe police chief said “a dispute over intellectual property” was tied to the UCLA shooting. \n“Everybody tries to look for a reason for this. Well, first of all, there is no good reason for this,” Beck told KTLA. “This is a mental issue, mental derangement, but it was tied to a dispute over intellectual property.” \nSarkar felt the professor he killed had released information “that harmed him,” Beck told the station. “UCLA says this is absolutely not true. This is the workings of his imagination.” \nPolice searching for vehicle \nSarkar, a 2013 Ph.D. graduate of the UCLA School of Engineering, had been living in Minnesota but drove to the Los Angeles area with two handguns and multiple rounds of ammunition, Beck told the CNN affiliate. \nHe went to his former professor’s fourth-floor office Wednesday and shot him dead with multiple rounds, then committed suicide, Beck said. The shooting sent the campus on lockdown for hours, leaving students shaken. \nInvestigators who rushed to the scene found a note, according to the police chief. \n“The note at UCLA said to ask for the finder to check on his cat in Minnesota. So we checked in (on) his cat in Minnesota at his residence. Actually we did a search warrant at his residence,” \nBeck told KTLA. \nThat’s where investigators found the kill list, Beck said. \nAnother UCLA professor’s name was on the list, according to the police chief. That professor was unharmed. \nAuthorities aren’t releasing the slain Minnesota woman’s name for now, Beck said, since investigators haven’t completed identification of notifying next of kin. \nPolice are searching for the gray 2003 Nissan Sentra Sarkar drove from Minnesota to California, Beck told KTLA. \nInside, the police chief said, “there will be evidence that will help us unravel this.” \n‘Our hearts are heavy’ \nSarkar is listed on a website for Klug’s research group at UCLA, and an online abstract of his dissertation lists Klug as his adviser. \nThe professor was described as an easygoing Little League coach, according to one friend, and an “an empathetic, brilliant teacher” as California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom put it. \nKlug’s friend fought back tears as he described the father of two to CNN affiliate KCBS-TV. \n“It’s hard to even fathom,” Lance Giroux said. “To have your son grow up without a dad, it’s rough.” \nThe professor was a proud coach of his young son’s baseball team, friends told KCBS. \n“(He was) always very positive. Kids loved working with him because he was such an easy coach to work with,” Giroux said. \nThe shooting shocked the student body. \n“Our hearts are heavy this evening as our campus family mourns the sudden and tragic deaths of two people on our campus earlier today,” said Chancellor Gene Block in an email Wednesday. “Our \nUCLA family has indeed been shaken, but we will rely upon the strong bonds of our community and our faith in one another as we begin the process of healing.” \nLos Angeles police said it got a call about the shooting around 10 a.m. PT. \nOfficials put the campus on lockdown as authorities investigated. Throngs of police with long guns patrolled the streets of the campus of more than 40,000 students. \nSWAT officers and dozens of squad cars filled the area as police tried to clear campus buildings floor by floor — a task that CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes called “monumental.” \nUCLA’s engineering building is in the middle of a densely populated part of Los Angeles. \nThe situation was contained shortly after noon, the police chief said. He said the shooting took place in a small office in the engineering building. \nIt was a jarring, tense time for the university’s students. To protect themselves, some blocked doors with printers, according to a picture on Twitter. \nFreshman Teddi Mattox said she was in a cafeteria getting breakfast along with about 100 other students when the shooting occurred. \n“We got the alert and a woman said, ‘This is not a joke, everyone get to the back of the dining hall because we have to stay away from the windows,’ ” she said. \nUCLA officials said they will review all campus safety procedures. \n“We’re pleased in the way notification went out, troubled by some reports of unlocked doors, but we want to review everything,” said Scott Waugh, UCLA’s executive vice chancellor and provost. \nUCLA also extended counseling services over the next few days to serve all the students who may be in need, Waugh said. \nThe university’s final exams are scheduled for next week, with graduation set for Friday. \nThe engineering school’s senior class dinner was scheduled for Thursday night. \nClasses were expected to resume for most of the university Thursday. At the engineering school, where the shooting occurred, classes will resume Monday, officials said. \nProfessor studied ‘interface’ of mechanics, biology \nKlug is listed as a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering on UCLA’s website. He received his undergraduate degree at Westmont College, then obtained a master’s degree at UCLA and a Ph.D. from Caltech. \nHe also led the Klug Research Group, which studied “problems at the interface of mechanics and biology.” \n“We aim to understand how the physical properties of biological structures and materials are involved in biological function from molecular and cellular scales upward,” the group’s website says. \n",

It was there that authorities found the \"kill list,\" which led them to a home in a nearby town, where they found the woman shot dead. \nShe was not identified and authorities didn't release how Sarkar knew her. \nBeck said it appeared mental issues were involved and that Sarkar's dispute with Klug was tied to Sarkar thinking the professor released intellectual property that harmed Sarkar. \nA blog post written in March by someone identifying himself as Sarkar said he had personal differences with Klug. \n\"He cleverly stole all my code and gave it (to) another student,\" the post says. \"He made me really sick.\" \nThe blog continues: \"Your enemy is your enemy. But your friend can do a lot more harm. Be careful about whom you trust. Stay away from this sick guy.\" \nBeck said UCLA asserts it was all in Sarkar's imagination. \nSarkar is listed on a UCLA website as a member of a computational biomechanics research group run by Klug, a professor of mechanical engineering. \nPolice were working Thursday to find the car Sarkar drove to Los Angeles and sought the public's help. \nClasses at the University of California, Los Angeles campus resumed Thursday for most of the school, except for the engineering department, where students and faculty will return Monday. \nKlug's colleagues and friends described him as a kind, devoted family man and teacher who didn't appear to have conflicts with anyone. \n\"Bill was an absolutely wonderful man, just the nicest guy you would ever want to meet,\" said a collaborator, UCLA Professor Alan Garfinkel. The two worked together to build a computer model of the heart, a \"50 million variable 'virtual heart' that could be used to test drugs.\" \nInitial reports from the scene set off widespread fears of an attempted mass shooting on campus, bringing a response of hundreds of heavily armed officers. Groups of them stormed into buildings that were locked down and cleared hallways as police helicopters hovered overhead. \nAdvised by university text alerts to turn off lights and lock doors where they were, many students let friends and family know they were safe in social media posts. Some described frantic evacuation scenes, while others wrote that their doors weren't locking and posted photos of photocopiers and foosball tables they used as barricades. \nThose locked down inside classrooms described a nervous calm. Some said they had to rig the doors closed with whatever was at hand. \nUmar Rehman, 21, was in a math sciences classroom adjacent to Engineering IV, the building where the shooting took place. The buildings are connected by walkway bridges near the center of the 419-acre campus. \n\"We kept our eye on the door. We knew that somebody eventually could come,\" he said, acknowledging his terror. \nThe door would not lock and those in the room devised a plan to hold it closed using a belt and crowbar, and demand ID from anyone who tried to get in. \nScott Waugh, an executive vice chancellor and provost, said the university would look into concerns about doors that would not lock. \nOne student who spent hours sheltering in a building did the same thing almost exactly two years ago when he was locked down in a dorm at UC Santa Barbara during a shooting rampage in the surrounding neighborhood that left six students dead and 13 people wounded. \nJeremy Peschard, 21, said it was \"eerily similar\" but that having been through the feeling of crisis before left him almost numb. \n\"I just felt a little bit less shocked, a little bit less taken aback by the reality of an active shooter on a college campus,\" he told The Associated Press in an email. \"Because I feel like this is the day and age we're living in, that college campus shootings have genuinely become a normalized threat, almost like a natural disaster, except this type of destruction isn't natural. It's just really sad.\" \n",

      "content": "LOS ANGELES -- The investigation into a murder-suicide on the UCLA campus took a more sinister turn Thursday when police announced they suspected the shooter earlier killed a woman in Minnesota then drove to Los Angeles to confront a professor he believed had stolen his work. \nDetectives also believe that Mainak Sarkar , a 38-year-old former engineering graduate student, intended to kill a second professor Wednesday morning, but could not find him on campus, Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck said. \nIn a search of Sarkar's home in St. Paul, Minnesota, authorities found a \"kill list\" with at least three names that included professor Bill Klug, the woman found dead in a Minneapolis suburb and a second UCLA professor who was not harmed, Beck said. \nThe Minnesota victim was identified as Ashley Hasti. She and Sarkar married in 2011, the Hennepin County Clerk's Office confirmed to CBS News. It was unclear whether the couple was still married at the time of the shooting; she was living at a different address from him at time of her death. \nCBS Minneapolis station WCCO-TV reported University of Minnesota officials said Hasti enrolled at the university's medical school in 2012 and was still a student there. She also received her undergraduate degree from the school in Asian Language and Literature from the college of liberal arts in 2008. \nSarkar shot and killed Klug, 39, in a UCLA engineering building, leading to a lockdown on the campus with 60,000 or more students and staff members. He then fatally shot himself. \nSarkar was \"heavily armed\" with two semi-automatic pistols and multiple magazines, Beck said. \n\"He was certainly prepared to engage multiple victims with the ordnance that he had at his disposal,\" Beck said. \nPolice believe the guns were legally purchased. Beck said at least one of the weapons was registered to Sarkar. \nSarkar drove to Los Angeles from Minnesota before he killed Klug. Beck asked for the public's help locating Sarkar's car, a 2003 gray Nissan Sentra with Minnesota license plate 720KTW. \nBeck said police believe the vehicle is \"likely to contain further evidence of the crime\" and will \"give a better picture of his motivations and intentions.\" \nHe left a note at the scene of the killing that asked anyone who found it to check on a cat at his home in Minnesota, Beck told reporters. It was there that authorities found the \"kill list,\" which led them to a home in a nearby town, where they found Hasti shot dead. \nEarly indications were that Hasti's death occurred before the murder-suicide at UCLA, police in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, said in a statement. \nHasti's grandmother told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune the couple \"just didn't get along.\" \nJean Johnson said her granddaughter and Sarkar split about a year after they married, and that Hasti moved back to her hometown of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota. They didn't get a divorce because Hasti couldn't afford one. \n\"The only enemy she had was him, I guess,\" Johnson said. \"I never thought he would do something like that.\" \nShe said Hasti hadn't mentioned any animosity with Sarkar since the two split. \nBeck said it appeared mental issues were involved and that Sarkar's dispute with Klug was tied to Sarkar thinking the professor released intellectual property that harmed Sarkar. \nA blog post written in March by someone identifying himself as Sarkar said he had personal differences with Klug. \n\"He cleverly stole all my code and gave it (to) another student,\" the post says. \"He made me really sick.\" \nThe blog continues: \"Your enemy is your enemy. But your friend can do a lot more harm. Be careful about whom you trust. Stay away from this sick guy.\" \nBeck said UCLA asserts it was all in Sarkar's imagination. \nSarkar is listed on a UCLA website as a member of a computational biomechanics research group run by Klug, a professor of mechanical engineering. Beck said Sarkar graduated from the school in 2013. \nIn his 2013 dissertation, Sarkar thanked Klug. The dissertation says: \"I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. William Klug, for all his help and support. Thank you for being my mentor.\" \nThe document thanks several other professors and three friends, with Sarkar saying, \"I will always remember all the good time we had together.\" \nThe dissertation, approved by Klug and four colleagues, is dedicated to Sarkar's dead mother, Ira Sarkar. It's titled, \"Coupled Cardiac Electrophysiology and Contraction using Finite Element.\" \nClasses at the University of California, Los Angeles campus resumed Thursday for most of the school, except for the engineering department, where students and faculty will return Monday. \nKlug's colleagues and friends described him as a kind, devoted family man and teacher who didn't appear to have conflicts with anyone. \n\"Bill was an absolutely wonderful man, just the nicest guy you would ever want to meet,\" said a collaborator, UCLA professor Alan Garfinkel. The two worked together to build a computer model of the heart, a \"50 million variable 'virtual heart' that could be used to test drugs.\" \nThe widow of Klug, Mary Elise Klug, released a statement Thursday. \n\"During this extremely difficult time for our family, we are grateful for the tremendous outpouring of support. This is an indescribable loss. Bill was so much more than my soulmate,\" she said. \"I will miss him every day for the rest of my life. Knowing that so many others share our family's sorrow has provided a measure of comfort.\" \nThe university is offering counseling services to students and staff affected by the shooting, CBS Los Angeles reported. Two GoFundMe accounts have been set up to assist with Klug's funeral costs. \nInitial reports from the scene set off widespread fears of an attempted mass shooting on campus, bringing a response of hundreds of heavily armed officers. Groups of them stormed into buildings that were locked down and cleared hallways as police helicopters hovered overhead. \nAdvised by university text alerts to turn off lights and lock doors where they were, many students let friends and family know they were safe in social media posts. Some described frantic evacuation scenes, while others wrote that their doors weren't locking and posted photos of photocopiers and foosball tables they used as barricades. \nThose locked down inside classrooms described a nervous calm.

      "content": "Police on Thursday identified the man they say carried out a murder-suicide that took the life of an engineering professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). \nThe shooter was Mainak Sarkar, said Officer Jenny Houser, a city police spokeswoman. Sarkar is listed on a UCLA website as a member of a computational biomechanics research group run by the victim, a professor of biomechanical engineering. \nThe shooting Wednesday brought a massive police response and widespread fear of an active shooter among tens of thousands of people at the university. Now fear has shifted to sadness as many lament the death of a professor who worked on computer models of the human heart who was also a doting father who coached his young son's baseball team. \nBill Klug, a professor of mechanical engineering, was gunned down in an engineering building office on Wednesday. Finding the gunman's motive in killing Klug was foremost in the investigation as it continued on Thursday. \nClasses at the UCLA campus resumed today for most of the school, and will resume on Monday for the engineering department, whose students and faculty were coming to grips with his loss. \n\"Bill was an absolutely wonderful man, just the nicest guy you would ever want to meet,\" said a collaborator, UCLA Professor Alan Garfinkel. \"Devoted family man, superb mentor and teacher to so many students. He was my close colleague and friend. Our research together was to build a computer model of the heart, a 50 million variable 'virtual heart' that could be used to test drugs.\" \nPeter Gianusso, who headed the El Segundo Little League where Klug coached, said he \"exemplified what Little League was all about: character, courage and loyalty. \n\"He had a special relationship with his son through baseball, was a great coach, spent countless hours on the field with the boys and girls of El Segundo Little League,\" Gianusso said. \nThe initial reports from the scene set off widespread fears of an attempted mass shooting on campus, bringing a response of hundreds of heavily armed officers who swarmed the campus. \nGroups of officers stormed into buildings that had been locked down and cleared hallways as police helicopters hovered overhead. \nAdvised by university text alerts to turn out the lights and lock the doors where they were, many students let friends and family know they were safe in social media posts. Some described frantic evacuation scenes, while others wrote that their doors weren't locking and posted photos of photocopiers and foosball [table football] tables they used as barricades. \nAfter about two hours, city Police Chief Charlie Beck said it was a murder-suicide and declared the threat over. Two men were dead, and authorities found a gun and what might be a suicide note, he said. \nIt was the week before final exams at UCLA, whose 43,000 students make it the largest campus in the University of California system. \n",

      "content": "LOS ANGELES) -- Hundreds of students gathered at the UCLA campus Thursday night to remember a professor who, authorities say, was shot and killed by a former student , who then took his own life. \nThe crowd gathered for a vigil Thursday night in Bruin Plaza, where the base of the bear mascot statue was covered with colored notes paying tribute to William Krug. \nThe 39-year-old engineering professor was shot in a campus office Wednesday by one of his former students, Mainak Sarkar, who then turned the gun on himself, authorities said. \nSarkar claimed Klug had stolen his computer code. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck says Sarkar was mentally unstable and the theft was all in his mind. \nColleagues, family and friends described Klug as a kind, devoted father and teacher. He is survived by his wife and two children, a 9-year-old boy and 7-year-old girl. \n\"Bill was so much more than my soul mate. I will miss him every day for the rest of my life,\" Klug's wife, Mary Elise Klug, said in a statement. \"Knowing that so many others share our family's sorrow has provided a measure of comfort.\" \nAuthorities said that, days before the shooting, Sarkar also shot and killed a woman in Minnesota. \nShe was identified as Ashley Hasti. She and Sarkar married in 2011, the Hennepin County Clerk's Office confirmed to CBS News. It was unclear whether the couple was still married at the time of the shooting; she was living at a different address from him at time of her death. \nCBS Minneapolis reported University of Minnesota officials said Hasti enrolled at the university's medical school in 2012 and was still a student there. She also received her undergraduate degree from the school in Asian Language and Literature from the college of liberal arts in 2008. \nAfter killing her, Sarkar made the long drive to Los Angeles, where he found his former mentor, Klug, and shot him before turning the gun on himself, investigators said. \nDetectives said they were still searching Friday for the vehicle Sarkar drove to L.A. \nBoth victims were on a \"kill list\" police had found at Sarkar's Minnesota apartment. A third person on the list, another UCLA professor, was spared because he wasn't on campus Wednesday when Sarkar arrived with two semi-automatic pistols, police said. \nAuthorities didn't publicly identify the unharmed professor. \nCriminal profilers say Sarkar's behavior fit a distinct pattern, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans. \nMary Ellen O'Toole, a forensic behavioral consultant, told CBS News, \"This shooter is what I call an injustice collector. ... My sense is ... what we'll find is that this individual's life was falling apart back in Minnesota ... and he was blaming these two professors from years ago.\" \nThe investigation was aided by a note Sarkar left in the office where he killed Klug. It asked anyone who read it to check on Sarkar's cat in St. Paul, Minnesota. \nHasti's grandmother, Jean Johnson, said Hasti and Sarkar only remained together for about a year, but didn't get a divorce because Hasti couldn't afford one. \n\"They just didn't get along,\" Johnson told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. \"The only enemy she had was him, I guess. I never thought he would do something like that.\" \nShe said she hadn't mentioned any recent animosity with Sarkar. \nSarkar had disparaged Klug online and the professor knew of his contempt, but police have not uncovered any death threats, Beck said. The writings contained \"some harsh language, but certainly nothing that would be considered homicidal,\" he said. \nA blog post written in March by someone identifying himself as Sarkar asserted that Klug \"cleverly stole all my code and gave it (to) another student\" and \"made me really sick.\" \nBeck said the investigation had shown Sarkar's claims of stolen code are \"a making of his own imagination.\" \nSarkar, 38, and Klug, 39, were once close. In his 2013 dissertation about using engineering to understand the human heart, the student thanked the professor \"for all his help and support. Thank you for being my mentor.\" \nSarkar's LinkedIn page shows he obtained a master's degree at Stanford University after graduating in 2000 from the Indian Institute of Technology at Kharagpur with a degree in aerospace engineering. \nHe most recently was listed as an engineering analyst at a Findlay, Ohio, company called Endurica. Company president Will Mars said Sarkar left in August 2014. \n",

      "content": "The shooting on the UCLA campus Wednesday was a murder-suicide, police said, and California authorities were no longer searching to see if any additional suspects were in the area. \n\"It appears it is entirely contained,\" LAPD Police Chief Charlie Beck said in a Wednesday afternoon press conference. \"We believe there are no suspects outstanding and no continuing threat to the UCLA campus.\" \nThe campus was placed on lockdown just before 10 a.m. after reports of a possible shooter in an engineering building, Boelter Hall. The LAPD was on a citywide tactical alert following the shooting. \nBeck said the shooting occurred in a small office. Both men were found dead at the scene. The identities of the men were not released, nor was any potential relationship. It was unclear if either or both were students or professors. \nA gun was recovered at the scene as was a piece of evidence that \"could be\" a suicide note, Beck said. \nThe LAPD was in the process of releasing students from lockdown. \n\"The campus is now safe,\" Beck said. \"The issue that has occurred has been contained.\" \nStudents reported hearing a loud noise and the sound of gun casings falling to the ground, UCPD Lt. Richard Davis said, according to The Daily Bruin. \nA law enforcement official told Fox News that assets from the FBI's Los Angeles field office responded to the shooting scene along with local partners, including LAPD. A separate law enforcement official said assets from ATF’s LA division were on scene. \n\"We just went to official lockdown in the dark!\" a school employee told FoxNews.com in a text message. \"All students moved to the back.\" \n\"We are in lockdown...but they seemed to be only focusing over on Boelter Hall because I literally just walked through campus to my building and went straight through to my office. Had no idea of what was going on till I got here!\" \nUniversity of California-Los Angeles | StartClass \nA tweet from the UCLA Bruin Alert account warned students to remain on lockdown. \n“Go to secure location and deny entry (lockdown) now!” a tweet said. \nOfficials placed Fairburn Elementary School, Warner Elementary School and Emerson Community Charter Middle School on lockdown as a precaution due to police activity in the area, according to the Los Angeles School Police Department. \nThe last day of classes at UCLA was scheduled for June 3. Graduation is set to take place on June 10 and June 11. \nFoxNews.com's Malia Zimmerman, Fox News' Matthew Dean and The Associated Press contributed to this report. \n",

      "content": "Los Angeles - Two men died Wednesday in a murder-suicide at the University of California's Los Angeles campus, prompting a lockdown and a massive security deployment at the sprawling facility. \nLos Angeles police chief Charlie Beck said both victims were found with gunshot wounds in an office on campus. At least three shots were fired and a gun was found at the scene. \n\"At about 10:00 this morning a homicide and a suicide occurred in the engineering facility... of the UCLA campus on the south side,\" Beck told reporters. \"It appears it is entirely contained.\" \n\"There is evidence there could be a suicide note but we don't know at this point,\" Beck added. \nThe shooting prompted a campus-wide lockdown as hundreds of officers and tactical response teams as well as federal agents rushed to the university, where students are in the middle of final exams. \nAll university classes were cancelled for the day and the lockdown was lifted at around noon. \n\"We are in the process of releasing the campus back to the students,\" Herren said. \"They are in their finals. This is a very stressful time for them, and we're trying to alleviate that.\" \nAround 43 000 students are enrolled at the massive UCLA campus, according to its website. \nStudents and staff on campus were urged to take cover when the shooting was first reported as officers went from building to building searching for a possible active shooter and other victims. \nMany students and staff could be seen walking out of buildings with their arms raised. \nStudents said they received alerts on their phones from the university notifying them of the shooting and advising them to take shelter. \nSeveral visibly shaken students told local media of hiding in bathrooms or classrooms as the situation unfolded. \nAuthorities also placed the city of Los Angeles on a tactical alert which means that police throughout the area could be mobilized. \nA nearby elementary school was also placed on lockdown. \nOfficials said they were still piecing together what prompted the murder-suicide. \n\"Tragically so many of these active shooter situations end like this,\" Beck said. \nThe White House said President Barack Obama had been notified of the California shooting and had asked his team to keep him updated on the situation. \nGun violence is a part of daily life in the United States where readily-available firearms claim around 30 000 lives each year. \nDemocratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton has called for \"comprehensive gun safety reform,\" although Obama's efforts at gun control have been hobbled by America's powerful gun lobby. \nThe National Rifle Association has endorsed the presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who boasts that he is a \"long-term\" NRA member and one of 13 million Americans with permits to carry firearms. \n",

      "content": "LOS ANGELES, CA - The Los Angeles City Council approved a measure today that would allow officials to identify the city's biggest dealers of guns that end up being used in crimes. \nAs part of the observance of National Gun Violence Awareness Day, the council voted 13-0 to have the Los Angeles Police Department work with the organization Crime Gun Solutions to analyze the city's data on gun traces to determine which dealers have the highest frequency of selling guns used in crime. \nCouncilman Paul Krekorian, who made the motion, said his goal is to \"determine the extent of the problem in Los Angeles so that we can take appropriate steps to protect the public.\" \n\"Our city has led the way on gun violence prevention issues, and I see this as another opportunity to reduce the number of families ripped apart by gun violence,\" he said. \nThe study will begin once the costs and administrative issues are worked out, according to Krekorian aide Ian Thompson. \nThe effort to analyze such data is part of a larger initiative launched by the Brady Campaign & Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, targeting the co- called \"bad apple\" dealers. \nChicago did a similar study in 2014 that found that four firearms dealers provided more than their proportionate share of guns used in crimes. The study led to at least one of the dealers changing practices, according to Krekorian's office. \nCity Attorney Mike Feuer and representatives of Women Against Gun Violence, the California chapters of the Brady Campaign and other groups also took part in a gun violence awareness day presentation at the City Council meeting today. \n",

      "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — A shooting that left two men dead at UCLA on Wednesday and led to a massive response on the campus in a bustling part of Los Angeles was a murder-suicide, authorities said. \nPolice Chief Charlie Beck declared the campus safe about two hours after authorities received a 911 call. The shooting happened in a small office in an engineering building called Boelter Hall, and a gun was found along with what might be a suicide note, he said. No names have been released. \nHundreds of officers from multiple federal and local agencies swarmed the campus, which had been placed on lockdown. Teams in tactical gear looking for victims and suspects ran across campus, some with weapons drawn, and stormed into buildings. People emerged from buildings with their hands raised or behind their heads. \nIn this image made from video, an officer leads people away from the scene of a fatal shooting at the University of California, Los Angeles, Wednesday, June 1, 2016, in Los Angeles. (KABC-7 via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT (Uncredited/AP) \nThe shooting occurred the week before final exams at UCLA, a major campus of the University of California system with about 43,000 students. \nMany students posted to social media, many to let friends and family know they were safe. Some described frantic evacuation scenes and a large police response. Others wrote that their doors weren't locking and posted photos of items like photocopiers and foosball tables pushed up against them. \nThe focus of police activity was a cluster of engineering buildings near the center of a campus that occupies 419 acres in Los Angeles. At a mathematical sciences building near Boelter Hall, SWAT officers with guns drawn cleared occupants who emerged one by one. \nOne man walked out with his hands up and was told to get on his knees. An armed officer searched him and his backpack, then sent him on his way with his hands still in the air. \nBioengineering professor Denise Aberle said she could see \"a lot of police activity with innumerable cars\" and a police helicopter hovering over the engineering building. \n\"Police keep coming,\" she said. \nAssociated Press writers Amanda Lee Myers, Christine Armario and Justin Pritchard in Los Angeles and Alina Hartounian in Phoenix contributed to this report. \n",

      "content": "Two people were killed in a murder-suicide on the UCLA campus Wednesday, prompting a campus-wide lockdown and forcing hundreds of terrified students to hide in buildings. \nMore from WMDT \nSuspects are no longer on the loose, and there is no continuing threat on campus, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said. He said the situation was contained, and a weapon was found. \nUCLA Police Chief James Herren said he did not know whether the two males killed were students or staff members. Both were found inside an engineering building. \nAuthorities had received reports of an active shooter in or near the building, Los Angeles Police Officer Tony Im said. \nOfficials put the campus on lockdown as authorities investigated the incident. Large groups of police with long guns patrolled the streets of the campus of more than 40,000 students. \nSWAT officers and dozens of squad cars filled the area as police tried to clear campus buildings floor by floor. \nFreshman Teddi Mattox said she was in a cafeteria getting breakfast with about 100 other students when the shooting occurred. \n\"We got the alert and a woman said, 'This is not a joke, everyone get to the back of the dining hall because we have to stay away from the windows,'\" she told CNN. \"We're crowded back here, we've been here for at least an hour and a half. People are crying, they're nervous, they're shaking. \n\"I have not stopped shaking for the last hour and a half,\" she said. \nLos Angeles police will lead the shooting investigation. Agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also were headed to the scene. \n\"So far we don't know the nature of the shooting,\" CNN senior law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes said. \n\"If it's a personal thing between a couple of students, then it will be a local police matter. If by chance it turned into a terrorist situation, then the FBI would have primary jurisdiction over that.\" \nLos Angeles police issued a citywide tactical alert, meaning officers on duty will be extended. \nPolice urged residents to avoid the UCLA campus. \nFuentes said locking down a large university in an urban area is a \"monumental task.\" UCLA's engineering building is in the middle of a very densely populated part of Los Angeles. \nAnd if an active shooter is on campus, police face an exceptional challenge, Fuentes said. \nUCLA's final exams are scheduled for next week, with graduation set for Friday. \nThe engineering school's senior class dinner was scheduled for Thursday night. \nAccording to UCLA, the school is known as the \"birthplace of the Internet\" because in 1969, the first transmission on what would become the Internet was sent from the engineering school's Boelter Hall. \n",

      "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Two people were shot and killed on the UCLA campus Wednesday, and it was possible one of them was the gunman, authorities in Los Angeles said. \nOfficers were still searching for any other victims and suspects who could be on the loose, said James Herren, chief of the police department at the University of California, Los Angeles. \nThe campus on the city’s west side was locked down, and dozens of officers with the LAPD and the university’s police force ran across the campus, some with weapons drawn. At one point, a team in tactical gear stormed into a building, and more than a dozen police cars massed near Boelter Hall, an engineering building. \nPeople emerged from buildings with their hands raised or behind their heads. Police told people to stay away from the campus in a bustling part of the city. \nTwo people were confirmed dead, LAPD Officer Aareon Jefferson told The Associated Press. \nThe shooting occurred the week before final exams at the school, the flagship of the University of California system with about 43,000 students. \nMany students posted to social media, many to let friends and family know they were safe. Some described frantic evacuation scenes and a large police response. Others wrote that their doors weren’t locking and posted photos of items like photocopiers and foosball tables pushed up against them. \nThe focus of police activity was a cluster of engineering buildings near the center of a campus that occupies 419 acres in Los Angeles. \nAt a mathematical sciences building near Boelter Hall, SWAT officers with guns drawn cleared occupants who emerged one by one. \nOne man walked out with his hands up and was told to get on his knees. An armed officer searched him and his backpack, then sent him on his way with his hands still in the air. \nBioengineering professor Denise Aberle said she could see “a lot of police activity with innumerable cars” and a police helicopter hovering over the engineering building. \n“Police keep coming,” she said. \nAssociated Press writers Amanda Lee Myers, Christine Armario and Justin Pritchard in Los Angeles and Alina Hartounian in Phoenix contributed to this report. \n",

Large groups of police with long guns patrolled the streets of the campus of more than 40,000 students. \nSWAT officers and dozens of squad cars filled the area as police tried to clear campus buildings floor by floor. \nFreshman Teddi Mattox said students were getting breakfast when the shooting occurred. \n\"We got the alert and a woman said, 'This is not a joke, everyone get to the back of the dining hall because we have to stay away from the windows,'\" she told CNN. \"We're crowded back here, we've been here for at least an hour and a half. People are crying, they're nervous, they're shaking. \" \nAgents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also were headed to the scene. \n\"So far we don't know the nature of the shooting,\" CNN senior law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes said. \n\"If it's a personal thing between a couple of students, then it will be a local police matter. If by chance it turned into a terrorist situation, then the FBI would have primary justification over that.\" \nLos Angeles police issued a citywide tactical alert, meaning officers on duty will be extended. \nPolice urged residents to avoid the UCLA campus. \nFuentes said locking down a large university in an urban area is a \"monumental task.\" UCLA's engineering building is in the middle of a very densely populated part of Los Angeles. \nAnd if an active shooter is on campus, police face an exceptional challenge, Fuentes said. \nUCLA's final exams are scheduled for next week, with graduation set for Friday. \n",

Police have described him as a white male about 6 feet tall wearing a black jacket and black pants, according to the Daily Bruin. \nUCPD Lt. Richard Davis said students told UCPD they heard a loud noise and gun shellings drop. Davis added he did not know when students first reported the incident. \nUCLA released a Bruin Alert about 9:52 a.m. informing students to find a secure location and lock entry. \nThe entire campus is on lockdown and police are asking anyone on campus to shelter in place. \nThe school on the west side of Los Angeles is a flagship of the University of California system, with about 43,000 students. It’s currently the week before final exams. \n",

Police have described him as a white male about 6 feet tall wearing a black jacket and black pants, according to the Daily Bruin. \nUCPD Lt. Richard Davis said students told UCPD they heard a loud noise and gun shellings drop. Davis added he did not know when students first reported the incident. \nUCLA released a Bruin Alert about 9:52 a.m. informing students to find a secure location and lock entry. \nThe entire campus is on lockdown and police are asking anyone on campus to shelter in place. \nThe school on the west side of Los Angeles is a flagship of the University of California system, with about 43,000 students. It’s currently the week before final exams. \nFurther details are unavailable at this time. \nWNCT-TV 9 On Your Side provides commenting to allow for constructive discussion on the stories we cover.

      "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) - Two people were shot and killed on the UCLA campus Wednesday, and it was possible one of them was the gunman, authorities in Los Angeles said. \nOfficers were still searching for any other victims and suspects who could be on the loose, said James Herren, chief of the police department at the University of California, Los Angeles. \nThe campus on the city's west side was locked down, and dozens of officers with the LAPD and the university's police force ran across the campus, some with weapons drawn. At one point, a team in tactical gear stormed into a building, and more than a dozen police cars massed near Boelter Hall, an engineering building. \nPeople emerged from buildings with their hands raised or behind their heads. Police told people to stay away from the campus in a bustling part of the city. \nTwo people were confirmed dead, LAPD Officer Aareon Jefferson told The Associated Press. \nThe shooting occurred the week before final exams at the school, the flagship of the University of California system with about 43,000 students. \nMany students posted to social media, many to let friends and family know they were safe. Some described frantic evacuation scenes and a large police response. Others wrote that their doors weren't locking and posted photos of items like photocopiers and foosball tables pushed up against them. \nThe focus of police activity was a cluster of engineering buildings near the center of a campus that occupies 419 acres in Los Angeles. \nAt a mathematical sciences building near Boelter Hall, SWAT officers with guns drawn cleared occupants who emerged one by one. \nOne man walked out with his hands up and was told to get on his knees. An armed officer searched him and his backpack, then sent him on his way with his hands still in the air. \nBioengineering professor Denise Aberle said she could see \"a lot of police activity with innumerable cars\" and a police helicopter hovering over the engineering building. \n\"Police keep coming,\" she said. \nAssociated Press writers Amanda Lee Myers, Christine Armario and Justin Pritchard in Los Angeles and Alina Hartounian in Phoenix contributed to this report. \n",

      "content": "LOS ANGELES (RNN) - The two men fatally shot inside an engineering school building on UCLA's campus Wednesday were the result of a homicide-suicide, according to the Los Angeles police chief. \n\"It appears it is entirely contained,\" Police Chief Charlie Beck said. \"We believe there are no suspects outstanding and no continuing threat to UCLA's campus.\" \nBeck reiterated that the campus was now safe, and they were working to \"release the campus back to the students.\" He said a gun was recovered, but a search of nearby buildings would continue out of an abundance of caution. \nUCLA Police Chief James Herren said \"hundreds\" of officers and agents were on the scene. The shooting took place inside the Engineering 4 building. \nHerren did not know of anyone else who was injured. The shooting happened around 10 a.m. \nLAPD Capt. Andy Neiman said tactical teams with UCLA police, the LAPD and the FBI responded, and scoured the building looking for any suspects. He said there had not been any reports of bombs or devices. \nUCLA reported a shooting on its Bruin Alert system at the Engineering 4 lab, telling people to secure their location and deny entry to others. \nPeople on campus posted updates to Twitter; a GIS coordinator at the school said the shooter was in his building, but he was safe and \"kinda scared.\" Another posted a photo of students tying off a door with a belt to secure it. \nStudents leaving the Math and Sciences buildings emerged with their hands up and were searched by police, keeping their hands above their heads. \nAaron Beltran, a nursing student, said he and other students were locked down a few buildings away. \n\"The building was locked down immediately,\" he said via Twitter. \"We are safe. Just a bunch of Nursing students. Waiting for news.\" \nUCLA students were taking final exams this week. Finals have been canceled for the rest of the day. \nEngineering 4 is a part of the engineering complex located in the central part of the campus. The building is adjacent to Boelter Hall, which houses offices for the Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science and the science and engineering library. \nThe engineering school offers summer programs for undergraduate research. \nUCLA is a public research university located on 419 acres in the western part of Los Angeles. It has a reported enrollment of 43,239. \nMore than 92,000 prospective freshmen applied to the school in 2015, one of the highest rates in the country. \n",

      "content": "Two people were shot and killed on the UCLA campus this morning, according to a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman. \nThe campus on the city's west side was locked down, and officers with the LAPD and the university's police force were running across the campus, some with weapons drawn. \nAt one point, a team in tactical gear stormed into a building, and more than a dozen police cars massed near Boelter Hall, an engineering building. \nPeople emerged from buildings with their hands raised or behind their heads. \nPolice told people to stay away from the campus in a bustling part of the city. \nTwo people were confirmed dead, LAPD Officer Aareon Jefferson told The Associated Press. \nPHOTO: Sheriff deputies work at the scene of a fatal shooting at the University of California, Los Angeles today. \nCampus media relations officer Rebecca Kendall said she did not know the whereabouts of the shooter. \nThe shooting occurred the week before final exams at the school, the flagship of the University of California system with about 43,000 students. \nMany students posted to social media, many to let friends and family know they were safe. Some described frantic evacuation scenes and a large police response, others wrote of sitting in darkened rooms after barricading doors. \nThe focus of police activity was a cluster of engineering buildings near the center of a campus that occupies 419 acres in Los Angeles. \nBioengineering professor Denise Aberle said she could see \"a lot of police activity with innumerable cars\" and a police helicopter hovering over the engineering building. \n",

The shooting happened in a small office in an engineering building called Boelter Hall, and a gun was found along with what might be a suicide note, he said. No names have been released. \nHundreds of officers from multiple federal and local agencies swarmed the campus, which had been placed on lockdown. Teams in tactical gear looking for victims and suspects ran across campus, some with weapons drawn, and stormed into buildings. People emerged from buildings with their hands raised or behind their heads. \nThe shooting occurred the week before final exams at UCLA, a major campus of the University of California system with about 43,000 students. \nMany students posted to social media, many to let friends and family know they were safe. Some described frantic evacuation scenes and a large police response. Others wrote that their doors weren't locking and posted photos of items like photocopiers and foosball tables pushed up against them. \nThe focus of police activity was a cluster of engineering buildings near the center of a campus that occupies 419 acres in Los Angeles. At a mathematical sciences building near Boelter Hall, SWAT officers with guns drawn cleared occupants who emerged one by one. \nOne man walked out with his hands up and was told to get on his knees. An armed officer searched him and his backpack, then sent him on his way with his hands still in the air. \nBioengineering professor Denise Aberle said she could see \"a lot of police activity with innumerable cars\" and a police helicopter hovering over the engineering building. \n\"Police keep coming,\" she said. \nAssociated Press writers Amanda Lee Myers, Christine Armario and Justin Pritchard in Los Angeles and Alina Hartounian in Phoenix contributed to this report. \n",

      "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) - A shooting that left two men dead at UCLA on Wednesday and led to a massive response on the campus in a bustling part of Los Angeles was a murder-suicide, authorities said. \nPolice Chief Charlie Beck declared the campus safe about two hours after authorities received a 911 call. The shooting happened in a small office in an engineering building called Boelter Hall, and a gun was found along with what might be a suicide note, he said. No names have been released. \nHundreds of officers from multiple federal and local agencies swarmed the campus, which had been placed on lockdown. Teams in tactical gear looking for victims and suspects ran across campus, some with weapons drawn, and stormed into buildings. People emerged from buildings with their hands raised or behind their heads. \nThe shooting occurred the week before final exams at UCLA, a major campus of the University of California system with about 43,000 students. \nMany students posted to social media, many to let friends and family know they were safe. Some described frantic evacuation scenes and a large police response. Others wrote that their doors weren't locking and posted photos of items like photocopiers and foosball tables pushed up against them. \nThe focus of police activity was a cluster of engineering buildings near the center of a campus that occupies 419 acres in Los Angeles. At a mathematical sciences building near Boelter Hall, SWAT officers with guns drawn cleared occupants who emerged one by one. \nOne man walked out with his hands up and was told to get on his knees. An armed officer searched him and his backpack, then sent him on his way with his hands still in the air. \nBioengineering professor Denise Aberle said she could see \"a lot of police activity with innumerable cars\" and a police helicopter hovering over the engineering building. \n\"Police keep coming,\" she said. \nAssociated Press writers Amanda Lee Myers, Christine Armario and Justin Pritchard in Los Angeles and Alina Hartounian in Phoenix contributed to this report. \n",

Police are investigating the shootings as a homicide and suicide. \n2 Dead in Murder-Suicide on UCLA Campus: Police \nThe campus was deemed safe about two hours after an emergency alert sent students running for cover. \nUCLA senior Bahjat Alirani was getting ready to take an exam in the building where gunfire erupted when he encountered police in the hallway. \nPhoto credit: NBC \n\"As soon as I got off the staircase, I saw a SWAT-looking police officer and he was pointing a big gun and and said for everyone to run and get out of the area,\" Alirani recalled. \"I look at my phone and see that the alert was saying 'shooting at Engineering 4.'\" \nAlirani said he tried to find a hiding place away from the building. \nAlex Darouie, a sophomore, told NBC San Diego he was walking from a parking garage on campus when he received an emergency alert from the university. \nHe rushed to the school music building, just a few hundred feet away from the engineering lab, where he hunkered down in a dark classroom with about 20 other students. \n\"Everybody is trying to keep it quiet. The lights are off,\" he said in a phone interview with NBC San Diego. \"Everybody is trying to not freak out right now.\" \nDarouie said he could hear little from inside the classroom — just the sound of students running for cover and police units swarming outside. \n— Carrie Rapaport ️ (@newt_ripley) June 1, 2016 \nAnother student, Carrie Rapaport, spoke with NBC San Diego on Twitter while huddled with classmates in the Broad Art Center. She tweeted a photo of a peer using her belt to secure the door. \n\"Everyone is sitting on the floor in the dark,\" she told NBC San Diego, adding she could hear helicopters circling overhead. \nPranasha Shrestha, who also tweeted from inside a classroom , posted a photo showing desks and chairs propped against the door. \n\"Doors open outward with no locks so we had to improvise our own locking mechanism,\" she captioned the image. \n",

      "content": "LOS ANGELES (RNN) - The two men fatally shot inside an engineering school building on UCLA's campus Wednesday were the result of a homicide-suicide, according to the Los Angeles police chief. \n\"It appears it is entirely contained,\" Police Chief Charlie Beck said. \"We believe there are no suspects outstanding and no continuing threat to UCLA's campus.\" \nBeck said a gun was recovered, but a search of nearby buildings would continue out of an abundance of caution. The campus has been reopened according to UCLA, although classes have been canceled. \nUCLA Police Chief James Herren said \"hundreds\" of officers and agents were on the scene. The shooting took place inside the Engineering 4 building. \nHerren did not know of anyone else who was injured. The shooting happened around 10 a.m. \nLAPD Capt. Andy Neiman said tactical teams with UCLA police, the LAPD and the FBI responded, and scoured the building looking for any suspects. He said there had not been any reports of bombs or devices. \nUCLA reported a shooting on its Bruin Alert system at the Engineering 4 lab, telling people to secure their location and deny entry to others. \nPeople on campus posted updates to Twitter; a GIS coordinator at the school said the shooter was in his building, but he was safe and \"kinda scared.\" Another posted a photo of students tying off a door with a belt to secure it. \nStudents leaving the Math and Sciences buildings emerged with their hands up and were searched by police, keeping their hands above their heads. \nAaron Beltran, a nursing student, said he and other students were locked down a few buildings away. \n\"The building was locked down immediately,\" he said via Twitter. \"We are safe. Just a bunch of Nursing students. Waiting for news.\" \nUCLA students were taking final exams this week. \nEngineering 4 is a part of the engineering complex located in the central part of the campus. The building is adjacent to Boelter Hall, which houses offices for the Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science and the science and engineering library. \nThe engineering school offers summer programs for undergraduate research. \nUCLA is a public research university located on 419 acres in the western part of Los Angeles. It has a reported enrollment of 43,239. \nMore than 92,000 prospective freshmen applied to the school in 2015, one of the highest rates in the country. \n",

At one point, a team in tactical gear stormed into a building, and more than a dozen police cars massed near Boelter Hall, an engineering building. \nPeople emerged from buildings with their hands raised or behind their heads. Police told people to stay away from the campus in a bustling part of the city. \nTwo people were confirmed dead, LAPD Officer Aareon Jefferson told The Associated Press. \nThe shooting occurred the week before final exams at the school, the flagship of the University of California system with about 43,000 students. \nMany students posted to social media, many to let friends and family know they were safe. Some described frantic evacuation scenes and a large police response. Others wrote that their doors weren't locking and posted photos of items like photocopiers and foosball tables pushed up against them. \nThe focus of police activity was a cluster of engineering buildings near the center of a campus that occupies 419 acres in Los Angeles. \nAt a mathematical sciences building near Boelter Hall, SWAT officers with guns drawn cleared occupants who emerged one by one. \nOne man walked out with his hands up and was told to get on his knees.

      "content": "LOS ANGELES (RNN) - The two men fatally shot inside an engineering school building on UCLA's campus Wednesday were the result of a homicide-suicide, according to the Los Angeles police chief. \n\"It appears it is entirely contained,\" Police Chief Charlie Beck said. \"We believe there are no suspects outstanding and no continuing threat to UCLA's campus.\" \nBeck said a gun was recovered, but a search of nearby buildings would continue out of an abundance of caution. The campus has been reopened according to UCLA, although classes have been canceled. \nUCLA Police Chief James Herren said \"hundreds\" of officers and agents were on the scene. The shooting took place inside the Engineering 4 building. \nHerren did not know of anyone else who was injured. The shooting happened around 10 a.m. \nLAPD Capt. Andy Neiman said tactical teams with UCLA police, the LAPD and the FBI responded, and scoured the building looking for any suspects. He said there had not been any reports of bombs or devices. \nUCLA reported a shooting on its Bruin Alert system at the Engineering 4 lab, telling people to secure their location and deny entry to others. \nPeople on campus posted updates to Twitter; a GIS coordinator at the school said the shooter was in his building, but he was safe and \"kinda scared.\" Another posted a photo of students tying off a door with a belt to secure it. \nStudents leaving the Math and Sciences buildings emerged with their hands up and were searched by police, keeping their hands above their heads. \nAaron Beltran, a nursing student, said he and other students were locked down a few buildings away. \n\"The building was locked down immediately,\" he said via Twitter. \"We are safe. Just a bunch of Nursing students. Waiting for news.\" \nUCLA students were taking final exams this week. \nEngineering 4 is a part of the engineering complex located in the central part of the campus. The building is adjacent to Boelter Hall, which houses offices for the Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science and the science and engineering library. \nThe engineering school offers summer programs for undergraduate research. \nUCLA is a public research university located on 419 acres in the western part of Los Angeles. It has a reported enrollment of 43,239. \nMore than 92,000 prospective freshmen applied to the school in 2015, one of the highest rates in the country. \n",

At one point, a team in tactical gear stormed into a building, and more than a dozen police cars massed near Boelter Hall, an engineering building. \nPeople emerged from buildings with their hands raised or behind their heads. Police told people to stay away from the campus in a bustling part of the city. \nTwo people were confirmed dead, LAPD Officer Aareon Jefferson told The Associated Press. \nThe shooting occurred the week before final exams at the school, the flagship of the University of California system with about 43,000 students. \nMany students posted to social media, many to let friends and family know they were safe. Some described frantic evacuation scenes and a large police response. Others wrote that their doors weren’t locking and posted photos of items like photocopiers and foosball tables pushed up against them. \nThe focus of police activity was a cluster of engineering buildings near the center of a campus that occupies 419 acres in Los Angeles. \nAt a mathematical sciences building near Boelter Hall, SWAT officers with guns drawn cleared occupants who emerged one by one. \nOne man walked out with his hands up and was told to get on his knees. An armed officer searched him and his backpack, then sent him on his way with his hands still in the air. \nBioengineering professor Denise Aberle said she could see “a lot of police activity with innumerable cars” and a police helicopter hovering over the engineering building. \n“Police keep coming,” she said. \nAmanda Lee Myers, Christine Armario and Justin Pritchard contributed from Los Angeles; Alina Hartounian contributed from Phoenix. \n",

      "content": "At least two people were shot dead at the University of California, Los Angeles on Wednesday, police and campus officials said, drawing officers in camouflage and tactical gear to the scene and prompting officials to lock down the campus. \nPolice were considering the possibility of a murder-suicide. \n“It is certainly possible that one of the victims is a shooter,” UCLA Police Chief James Herren told reporters. \nCBS News, citing an unidentified police source, said investigators no longer considered it an active shooter situation and that it was believed to be a murder-suicide. \nPolice found a suicide note and handgun, NBC Los Angeles reported, citing an unidentified source. \nLos Angeles Police Department spokesman Aareon Jefferson reported two fatalities from the shooting but could not confirm any details about the victims or provide further information about the suspect. \n“The LAPD is continuing a methodical search of the campus and surrounding areas,” police said in a statement. \nThe campus remained on lockdown, UCLA’s office of media relations said. \n— LAPD Online News (@LAPDonlinenews) June 1, 2016 \nBioengineering student Bahjat Alirani said police were yelling at people to run from the scene. \n“I was in Boelter Hall to take a final and I exit the staircase to see SWAT-looking police yelling at everyone to evacuate immediately,” Alirani told Reuters. \nUCLA, with more than 43,000 enrolled students, is in the Westwood section of Los Angeles and one of the more well-regarded schools in the University of California system, known for its successful sports program. \nPolice received multiple calls of shots fired around 10 a.m. (1700 GMT), triggering an immediate search for suspects and victims by LAPD and campus police, officials said. \nPolice confirm 2 dead in shooting at UCLA. Police are sweeping Engineering IV building for a possible shooter. Watch for updates. \n— UCLA Newsroom (@UCLAnewsroom) June 1, 2016 \nAt least three city blocks leading into the campus were filled with dozens of emergency vehicles. Officers in camouflage uniforms with rifles, bulletproof vests and helmets surrounded the scene of the shooting. \nAn armored car was parked in the middle of one intersection, and helicopters were flying overhead. \nStudents and other bystanders stood calmly, taking pictures on their cell phones and watching the emergency workers. \nErica Roberts, a sophomore economics major from Rockville, Maryland, said she took shelter inside the student health center about 10 minutes after she had arrived for work there. \n“Everyone is really on edge and contacting loved ones to let them know we are safe,” she said in a telephone interview. “I’m trying to stay in contact with all my friends on campus to make sure they are OK. Everyone is just terrified.” \n",

      "content": "LOS ANGELES (RNN) - The two men fatally shot inside an engineering school building on UCLA's campus Wednesday were the result of a homicide-suicide, according to the Los Angeles police chief. \n\"It appears it is entirely contained,\" Police Chief Charlie Beck said. \"We believe there are no suspects outstanding and no continuing threat to UCLA's campus.\" \nBeck said a gun was recovered, but a search of nearby buildings would continue out of an abundance of caution. The campus has been reopened according to UCLA, although classes have been canceled. \nUCLA Police Chief James Herren said \"hundreds\" of officers and agents were on the scene. The shooting took place inside the Engineering 4 building. \nHerren did not know of anyone else who was injured. The shooting happened around 10 a.m. \nLAPD Capt. Andy Neiman said tactical teams with UCLA police, the LAPD and the FBI responded, and scoured the building looking for any suspects. He said there had not been any reports of bombs or devices. \nUCLA reported a shooting on its Bruin Alert system at the Engineering 4 lab, telling people to secure their location and deny entry to others. \nPeople on campus posted updates to Twitter; a GIS coordinator at the school said the shooter was in his building, but he was safe and \"kinda scared.\" Another posted a photo of students tying off a door with a belt to secure it. \nStudents leaving the Math and Sciences buildings emerged with their hands up and were searched by police, keeping their hands above their heads. \nAaron Beltran, a nursing student, said he and other students were locked down a few buildings away. \n\"The building was locked down immediately,\" he said via Twitter. \"We are safe. Just a bunch of Nursing students. Waiting for news.\" \nUCLA students were taking final exams this week. \nEngineering 4 is a part of the engineering complex located in the central part of the campus. The building is adjacent to Boelter Hall, which houses offices for the Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science and the science and engineering library. \nThe engineering school offers summer programs for undergraduate research. \nUCLA is a public research university located on 419 acres in the western part of Los Angeles. It has a reported enrollment of 43,239. \nMore than 92,000 prospective freshmen applied to the school in 2015, one of the highest rates in the country. \n",

      "content": "LOS ANGELES – Two people were shot and killed on the UCLA campus Wednesday, and it was possible one of them was the gunman, authorities in Los Angeles said. \nOfficers were still searching for any other victims and suspects who could be on the loose, said James Herren, chief of the police department at the University of California, Los Angeles. \nThe campus on the city's west side was locked down, and dozens of officers with the LAPD and the university's police force ran across the campus, some with weapons drawn. At one point, a team in tactical gear stormed into a building, and more than a dozen police cars massed near Boelter Hall, an engineering building. \nPeople emerged from buildings with their hands raised or behind their heads. Police told people to stay away from the campus in a bustling part of the city. \nTwo people were confirmed dead, LAPD Officer Aareon Jefferson told The Associated Press. \nThe shooting occurred the week before final exams at the school, the flagship of the University of California system with about 43,000 students. \nMany students posted to social media, many to let friends and family know they were safe. Some described frantic evacuation scenes and a large police response. Others wrote that their doors weren't locking and posted photos of items like photocopiers and foosball tables pushed up against them. \nThe focus of police activity was a cluster of engineering buildings near the center of a campus that occupies 419 acres in Los Angeles. \nAt a mathematical sciences building near Boelter Hall, SWAT officers with guns drawn cleared occupants who emerged one by one. \nOne man walked out with his hands up and was told to get on his knees. An armed officer searched him and his backpack, then sent him on his way with his hands still in the air. \nBioengineering professor Denise Aberle said she could see \"a lot of police activity with innumerable cars\" and a police helicopter hovering over the engineering building. \n",

      "content": "The call came from the UCLA campus just before 10 a.m. – someone had opened fire with a gun. “Active shooter,” and the warning went out for those on campus to shelter in place. Where was it? The Engineering 4 building. \nPolice arrived in waves, along with firefighters and other emergency responders. The Los Angeles Police Department went on citywide tactical alert, the better to marshal resources, as television showed students being escorted to safety, hands on their heads, by officers in tactical gear. \nAnd then the wait. What had happened? Was there still someone with a gun? Was it still dangerous? Was this going to be another horrific scene of of violence, like that at Umpqua Community College in Oregon in October? \nBut there were no more bullets. No confirmed sightings of a man with a gun still at his deadly work. Something less dramatic, apparently, had occurred, something smaller in scope than the mass shootings we’ve become accustomed to. \nThe massive police and emergency response proved unnecessary, but there was no way the LAPD could have known that when the panicked call came in. And this is where we are – the anticipation that a shooting on a college campus was going to turn out to be a mass tragedy, and that a major city’s law enforcement response is geared up for that eventuality. \nIn this case, it was only two dead. Murder-suicide in a small office. And so America shrugs. Just another incident in the daily parade of gun violence that defines contemporary America. And so two families, and two circles of friends, and a community of students and faculty are left to their grief, and their confusion, and maybe a touch more fear than usual at the recognition that violence can and will strike so close to home. \nUltimately, we should be glad this was a tragedy for fewer people than feared when the phrase “campus shooting” first popped up on screens. But that society will just shrug this off is tragic in its own way. That the nation accepts gun violence as commonplace, as a reasonable trade-off for some romanticized view of every gun owner as a soldier against tyranny, is the continuing tragedy. \n",

Some described frantic evacuation scenes and a large police response. Others wrote that their doors weren't locking and posted photos of items like photocopiers and foosball tables pushed up against them. \nThe focus of police activity was a cluster of engineering buildings near the center of a campus that occupies 419 acres in Los Angeles. \nAt a mathematical sciences building near Boelter Hall, SWAT officers with guns drawn cleared occupants who emerged one by one. \n[ See also - Focus shifts to bullies after prom shooting ] \nOne man walked out with his hands up and was told to get on his knees.
