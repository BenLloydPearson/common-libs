Well, i'm going to purchase a
video camera. The canon rebel
will be used mostlyy for picture
use.
If you aren't getting it for mostly video use then you could step down and get something cheaper, like this: http://shrt.st/h0p
Depends on what you're going to do with it. It's main purpose is for shooting photos with video being a secondary feature. You have a recording length of under 15 minutes per clip so you can't really record long shots if you're doing an interview or things of that nature.

The picture is great but if you're looking for heavy use video camera, you should invest in something else. It'll be cheaper.
I wan't to get this camera,
but it's super expensive!O:
Is it worth the moneyy?
