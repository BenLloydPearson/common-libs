for Information Processing Language

Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw, H. Simon, RAND ca. 1954

The first list-processing language, also the first language to support recursion.

IPL-I was a theoretical design and never actually implemented. IPL-II written on JOHNNIAC, said by Sammet to be "one of the most significant events that has ever occurred in programming." IPL-V the first widely used non-numeric system
