1. If your throat tickles, scratch your ear!\n\nWhen you were 9, playing your armpit was a cool trick. Now, as an adult, you can\nstill appreciate a good body-based feat, but you're more discriminating. Take that\ntickle in your throat; it's not worth gagging over. Here's a better way to scratch\nyour itch: " When the nerves in the ear are stimulated, it creates a reflex in the \ nthroat that can cause a muscle spasm, " says Scott Schaffer, M.D., president of an\near, nose, and throat specialty center in Gibbsboro, New Jersey. " This spasm \ nrelieves the tickle.
  "\n2. Experience supersonic hearing!\n\nIf you're stuck chatting up a mumbler at a cocktail party, lean in with your right\near. It's better than your left at following the rapid rhythms of speech,\naccording to researchers at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine. If, on the\nother hand, you're trying to identify that song playing softly in the elevator,\nturn your left ear toward the sound. The left ear is better at picking up music\ntones.\n3. Overcome your most primal urge!\n\nNeed to pee? No bathroom nearby? Fantasize about Jessica Simpson. Thinking about\nsex preoccupies your brain, so you won't feel as much discomfort, says Larry\nLipshultz, M.D., chief of male reproductive medicine at the Baylor College of\nMedicine. For best results, try Simpson's " These Boots Are Made for Walking "\nvideo.\n4. Feel no pain!\n\nGerman researchers have discovered that coughing during an injection can lessen\nthe pain of the needle stick. According to Taras Usichenko, author of a study on\nthe phenomenon, the trick causes a sudden, temporary rise in pressure in the chest\nand spinal canal, inhibiting the pain-conducting structures of the spinal cord.\n5. Clear your stuffed nose!\n\nForget Sudafed. An easier, quicker, and cheaper way to relieve sinus pressure is\nby alternately thrusting your tongue against the roof of your mouth, then pressing\nbetween your eyebrows with one finger. This causes the vomer bone, which runs\nthrough the nasal passages to the mouth, to rock back and forth, says Lisa\nDeStefano, D.O., an assistant professor at the Michigan State University college\nof osteopathic medicine. The motion loosens congestion; after 20 seconds, you'll\nfeel your sinuses start to drain.\n6. Fight fire without water!\n\nWorried those wings will repeat on you tonight? " Sleep on your left side, " says\nAnthony A. Starpoli, M.D., a New York City gastroenterologist and assistant\nprofessor of medicine at New York Medical College. Studies have shown that\npatients who sleep on their left sides are less likely to suffer from acid reflux.\n\nThe esophagus and stomach connect at an angle. When you sleep on your right, the\nstomach is higher than the esophagus, allowing food and stomach acid to slide up\nyour throat. When you're on your left, the stomach is lower than the esophagus, so\ngravity's in your favor.\n7. Cure your toothache without opening your mouth!\n\nJust rub ice on the back of your hand, on the V-shaped webbed area between your\nthumb and index finger. A Canadian study found that this technique reduces\ntoothache pain by as much as 50 percent compared with using no ice. The nerve\npathways at the base of that V stimulate an area of the brain that blocks pain\nsignals from the face and hands.\n8. Make burns disappear!\n\nWhen you accidentally singe your finger on the stove, clean the skin and apply\nlight pressure with the finger pads of your unmarred hand. Ice will relieve your\npain more quickly, Dr. DeStefano says, but since the natual method brings the\nburned skin back to a normal temperature, the skin is less likely to blister.\n9. Stop the world from spinning!\n\nOne too many drinks left you dizzy? Put your hand on something stable. The part of\nyour ear responsible for balance -- the cupula -- floats in a fluid of the same\ndensity as blood. " As alcohol dilutes blood in the cupula, the cupula becomes less \ ndense and rises, " says Dr. Schaffer. This confuses your brain. The tactile input\nfrom a stable object gives the brain a second opinion, and you feel more in\nbalance. Because the nerves in the hand are so sensitive, this works better than\nthe conventional foot-on-the-floor wisdom.\n10. Unstitch your side!\n\nIf you're like most people, when you run, you exhale as your right foot hits the\nground. This puts downward pressure on your liver (which lives on your right\nside), which then tugs at the diaphragm and creates a side stitch, according to\nThe Doctors Book of Home Remedies for Men. The fix: Exhale as your left foot\nstrikes the ground.\n11. Stanch blood with a single finger!\n\nPinching your nose and leaning back is a great way to stop a nosebleed -- if you don't mind choking on your own O positive. A more civil approach: Put some cotton on your upper gums -- just behind that small dent below your nose -- and press against it, hard. " Most bleeds come from the front of the septum, the cartilage wall that divides the nose, " says Peter Desmarais, M.D., an ear, nose, and throat specialist at Entabeni Hospital, in Durban, South Africa. " Pressing here helps stop them."\n12. Make your heart stand still!\n\nTrying to quell first-date jitters? Blow on your thumb. The vagus nerve, which\ngoverns heart rate, can be controlled through breathing, says Ben Abo, an\nemergency medical- services specialist at the University of Pittsburgh. It'll get\nyour heart rate back to normal.\n13. Thaw your brain!\n\nToo much Chipwich too fast will freeze the brains of lesser men. As for you, press\nyour tongue flat against the roof of your mouth, covering as much as you can.\n" Since the nerves in the roof of your mouth get extremely cold, your body thinks \ nyour brain is freezing, too, " says Abo. " In compensating, it overheats, causing an \ nice -cream headache." The more pressure you apply to the roof of your mouth, the\nfaster your headache will subside.\n14. Prevent near-sightedness!\n\nPoor distance vision is rarely caused by genetics, says Anne Barber, O.D., an\noptometrist in Tacoma, Washington. " It 's usually caused by near - point stress." In\nother words, staring at your computer screen for too long. So flex your way to\n20/20 vision. Every few hours during the day, close your eyes, tense your body,\ntake a deep breath, and, after a few seconds, release your breath and muscles at\nthe same time. Tightening and releasing muscles such as the biceps and glutes can\ntrick involuntary muscles -- like the eyes -- into relaxing as well.\n15. Wake the dead!\n\nIf your hand falls asleep while you're driving or sitting in an odd position, rock\nyour head from side to side. It'll painlessly banish your pins and needles in less\nthan a minute, says Dr. DeStefano. A tingly hand or arm is often the result of\ncompression in the bundle of nerves in your neck; loosening your neck muscles\nreleases the pressure. Compressed nerves lower in the body govern the feet, so\ndon't let your sleeping dogs lie. Stand up and walk around.\n16. Impress your friends!\n\nNext time you're at a party, try this trick: Have a person hold one arm straight\nout to the side, palm down, and instruct him to maintain this position. Then place\ntwo fingers on his wrist and push down. He'll resist. Now have him put one foot on\na surface that's a half inch higher (a few magazines) and repeat. This time his\narm will cave like the French. By misaligning his hips, you've offset his spine,\nsays Rachel Cosgrove, C.S.C.S., co-owner of Results Fitness, in Santa Clarita,\nCalifornia. Your brain senses that the spine is vulnerable, so it shuts down the\nbody's ability to resist.\n17. Breathe underwater!\n\nIf you're dying to retrieve that quarter from the bottom of the pool, take several\nshort breaths first -- essentially, hyperventilate. When you're underwater, it's\nnot a lack of oxygen that makes you desperate for a breath; it's the buildup of\ncarbon dioxide, which makes your blood acidic, which signals your brain that
