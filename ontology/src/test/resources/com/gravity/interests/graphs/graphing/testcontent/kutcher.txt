And the new star of Two and a Half Men isâ€¦ Ashton Kutcher. The Hollywood Reporter says the actor is "putting the final touches" on a deal that will have him replacing the fired Charlie Sheen in the series, which is TV's number one comedy. Specifics of his deal aren't known, but the Reporter says Kutcher is getting a "huge payday" for the series.

CBS was working hard to line up a new star for the series before their Upfront presentation next week, when they announce their full 2011-2012 lineup. Hugh Grant came close to signing on, but that deal fell through several days ago. The Reporter says that after talks with Grant broke down, Kutcher's deal came together quickly.

A source close to the project tells the Reporter that when it comes to Kutcher's introduction, "It's really funny. People are going to love it."

We still want to know how the show will deal with writing Sheen off, without him making a final appearance. Hopefully the writers have paid attention to our suggestions.
